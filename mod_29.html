This is a framework that fuels all KI5 mods, one centralized place to fine tune and expand all mods and make them ready for game changes and new features.
You can find more about it here:
that DAMN Library - Crafting, Fixing and Recycling explained
Why do i need this?
It is a required mod for running KI5 mods.
It will soon become a required mod for all previously released mods.
Those updates will be released in the coming weeks and will cover all KI5 mods, expanding them with crafting and recycling features for almost all parts, handy tire repair kit and many other things. All of those features are already available to most mods already released, try them out.
Why are the comments closed?
There is no need for them here, all mod related stuff can be discussed on mod pages of those mods.
Can I use this for my mods?
Not yet, the contents of this library will be changing in the next weeks without any warnings so it's better to wait while we fine tune the things and give a green light for wide use.
I found a bug, what now?
Hit the discussions of affected mods and give us detailed report of what happened.
If you like the mod, you can buy us a coffee
