2023-02-15 - Pushing fix for some casual edition errors. Early draft of two "Anywhere But.." sub-mods allowing you to spawn anywhere, except for some place you'd rather not spawn.
2022-11-16 - Add note of Ekron's canonical name as "Fallas Lake". Add MP Resources folder within "MP Edition" folder, which is also available on Github.
2021-12-15 - Add MP Edition with reduced selection due to spawn locations not being able to be safe houses.
2021-12-14 - Add Louisville as a sub-mod w/ 41.60+ requirement
Here is the database of all locations possible :

So many thanks to blindcoder's tool that allows me to easily see these locations and pinpoint the coordinates
https://map.projectzomboid.com/
Variations of mod are packed as separate sub-mods that need to be enabled for those options to show on the spawn selection menu.
