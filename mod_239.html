As you've probably noticed, I've updated my map, "Over the River",
changing the bridge and replacing the old ship with a new one, much more complete.

Since the ship is now full of loot, secret passages, secret rooms etc, it is no longer just a way through, but a real location to visit. At the time I created the map, vehicles had not been implemented yet, so willy-nilly, the only way to go there was on foot. I add this map as a separate mod because I'll probably be expanding it northwards in the future, with numerous updates, and since the other map is also used for Build 40 in multiplayer, having this as a sperate mod will allow me to update it and work on in without creating problems for the 41.000 subscribers of the main mod. If you don't want to have this second bridge, you can simply disable it from the mod list.
