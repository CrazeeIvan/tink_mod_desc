This mod fixes a performance issue in the game that causes it to freeze up for a period of time, most commonly whenever you rip up clothing.
The problem becomes exponentially worse with the more clothing item mods you have, hence why it's the primary culprit.
The code is a classic example of "accidentally quadratic" If you care about the details, read on. If not, just download it.
What the vanilla game does that causes this problem
The game wants to show you a tooltip of the top 10 items that are valid for a given recipe, so it:
1. Builds a complete list of all valid items, in no particular order.
2. Sorts this complete list to move all items you actually have to the top -
O(n)
complexity.
3. Removes any items that are considered duplicates by virtue of being applicable to different slots (e.g. Left/right handed wristwatch) -
O(n^2)
complexity!
4. Renders the top 10 items of the list, ignoring anything else.
This is wasteful because it processes the full list of items, even though we only care about the top 10.
What this mod makes it do
1. We build a complete list of valid items, but any items that exist in your inventory are sent to the start of the list,
at the point of insertion
.
2. The list is truncated to the first 10 items and only these are sorted. We store the original length of the list for later -
O(1)
complexity.
3. Deduplication occurs as in vanilla, but, again, the list is now only 10 items long -
O(1)
complexity.
4. We render the list again. If there were more than 10 items, we ensure that the "and X more" text is computed correctly from the pre-truncation list size.
