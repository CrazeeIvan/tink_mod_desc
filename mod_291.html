Now you can use a blowtorch and welding mask to remove the tiresome eyesores and get some salvage to boot.
Wrecks require a base of 0.5 units of propane to salvage. Non wrecks require more depending on how many parts are still installed. Base is reduced by 0.025 units per level in the mechanic skill.
Wrecks may yield engine parts, brakes and suspension parts of low condition. Non wrecks may yield their parts, but at a lowered condition due to using a blowtorch to remove them.
Any inventory contained in a salvaged vehicle will be destroyed. This is intended behavior.
