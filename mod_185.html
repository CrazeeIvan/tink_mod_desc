A small Gas station and Military Outpost are also located nearby.
It has a spawn point but that's just more so you can get to the area quick to have a look around. You will spawn on the main road just down from the gas station.
This is my first ever map so any feedback, tips and trick for improvements etc are welcome.
Special thanks to Daddy Dirk, Dylan and throttlekitty for the amazing tile packs!
