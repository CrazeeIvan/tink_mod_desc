Snow is still water, so Rain Collectors and Metal Barrels will be filled when snowing, just at a slower rate (50%).
It's a small mod that I created for myself for winter storm playthroughs. It works great paired with mods such as
Cryogenic winter
,
Eternal Snow
or
Infinite Weather
. Mod won't be updated for a while since people don't like that as much and I don't have much time.
The standard version works in SP and MP the latest builds!
WARNING
Do not use the beta version (snowiswaterbeta), it's been broken for versions past 41.74 and I don't have time to fix it. If you want to use the mod, use the Standard version/mod file (snowiswater)
Features
Included in the
Standard Version
( snowiswater ):
Rain Barrels (both variants) are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%).
Metal Barrels are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%).
In the
Beta Version
( snowiswaterbeta ):
Once again, do not use past version v41.75
Items such as Pots and Buckets will also fill up when snowing with tainted water. This should work without a problem in MP, but it's labeled as a beta version since there could be some issues with it.
Added configurable settings with "
ModOptions
" to change the ratio in which all the items fill up. The default is 50% but can be changed to 25%, 75% and even 100%.
Planned features (WIP):
Improved option to add "realism" to the snow/water limit and filling rate on barrels.
Texture changes deppending on the weather.
Beta Incompatibilities
As of patch 41.74, I have been informed that certain mods that add new items seem to break when the full version is working. I am currently working on a fix to adress these issues but it may take a while. For now, either switch to the "lite" version of my mod or try to avoid mods that add "fillable" containers, as they will be the ones causing the errors (i.e: Snake's mod pack).
As of newer versions, the Beta version of the mod breaks certain actions due to the way the mod overides functions. I recommend to stop using the beta version and use the standard for now.
If you liked the mod, please let me know
I really appreciate all the comments and positive feedback I've received. Thanks a lot to all of you who decided to spend some time to write them down :)
