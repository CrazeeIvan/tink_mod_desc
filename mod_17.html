Looking at the news from the build 42, a big crafting change is on the way. This mod may lose the main use intended, so have that in mind when thinking about developing around this mod. Although we still don't know when build 42 will be available, it will probably have big impact into many mechanics of the game.
Crafting Enhanced Core
Project Zomboid Mod that add 5 new tables to use for crafting. This mod is primarily meant to be use by other mods to expand and modify the crafting experience.
By itself this mod only add the tiles and the ability to build them in the world.
Just to clarify, it
does not add any new recipe
. Later down the line i will make an other mod that adds some custom recipes but i first want to make a mining mod.

Roadmap
Due to work, I'm lacking free time, so I will postpone the previously mentioned roadmap to when the build 42 is released. I will continue to give support to the mods I upload, but I will not be as proactively creating new ones.
