"In the dark times, should the stars also go out?"
üó∫Ô∏èElysium Island is a map mod located west of Westpoint.
-There is a couple of wrong room defs (it's not game breaking, and the map doesn't support loot respawn). I know about these issues. But I won't be updating the map. It will break too many saves and I don't have the time. Please enjoy the map as it is.

The mod includes
A spawn point in the Whirling-In-Rags, a hostel cafeteria
Working ingame map.
Foraging
One particular warehouse floor doesn't have lights. You'll need a torch to discover a gruesome secret.
Very close to Westpoint or a great base spot 'three houses by the lake'.
There is a chance vehicles can spawn outside in the parking bay.
It is a destroyed and poor area, that lacks in policing and investments. Inspired by Martinaise from 'Disco Elysium' you may find a few familiar locations. Spoilers are kept to a minimum, so it should be enjoyable for anyone who wants to try it out.
Why not try the Disco Elysium Clothing pack, found here
