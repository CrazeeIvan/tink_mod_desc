burnt town
[pzwiki.net]
in the outskirts of Louisville and adds an abandoned military quarantine zone. The map is located inside the
Exclusion Zone border
[pzwiki.net]
and contains a small town and a nearby trailer park. All burned down buildings have been rebuilt and military structures and barricades have been added. The security fencing has been expanded around the zone.
This map can be used as a multiplayer safe zone or settlement. The zone has multiple buildings that can be used as safe houses and the zombie population is low in the area.

Spawn locations
This map currently has two spawn points, one inside the town and one inside the trailer park.
Map location
The quarantine zone is located in the center of the exclusion border south of Louisville and replaces cell 44x13, 45x13 and 46x13 on the vanilla map. The easiest way to get into the zone is to spawn inside it. You can also drive there but it might require a sledgehammer if the gates are locked. This mod conflicts with other mods that use the same cells.
