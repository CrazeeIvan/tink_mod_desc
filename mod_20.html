<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732294885' target='_blank'>Mod 20</a></h2><p>Renames all VHS tapes to include the skill they level up.
This removes the need to consult the wiki or Steam guides when searching for relevant VHS tapes.
The mod only modifies the translation for the specific VHS items for the specified languages. Because of this, it is
completely safe
to add and remove this mod during a playthrough.
I am the only person maintaining this mod and, although I do not speak all the supported languages, I have made every effort to translate the relevant VHS tapes accurately, in line with Project Zomboids localization.
Enjoy!
