Features
Quits the server when a workshop update is detected (pair it with an auto-restart script, cron job, or service to turn it into an auto-restart!)
Configurable restart delay time with warnings to users as the time approaches.
Logs what mod(s) are triggering the update by title and workshop ID to the server log (for easier troubleshooting if issues come up).
Configurable workshop polling interval so that you check only as often as you want to - with long mod lists this is a must!
Configurable delay between saving and quitting the server to avoid data loss/reversions.
Kicks all players before the save/quit delay to avoid data loss/reversions.
Fully compatible with chat mods (on a technical level I expanded the server alert message table's function support) like PARPChat and Buffy's Roleplay Chat, etc..
If you set RestartDelayMinutes to zero it will only restart when all users have left the server if that's what you'd prefer.
Chat commands /restart, /restartnow, /schedulerestart N, /checkworkshop.
