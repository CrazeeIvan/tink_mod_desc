⠀⠀St Paulo's Hammer was always a hot spot for army related businesses, starting as a simple town for gunpowder companies back in the early days of freedom land, it quickly became a busy town for all topics army related as the raging conflicts of the 20th century fed the war machine, with the fall of soviet union the army has been slowly pulling out its funds from the local weapons manufacturing and research industry.
⠀⠀ Considering the large ammount of weapons and ammo being produced behind gates, one could only wonder what use would these weapons find in the peacefullness of 93s US...
𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰! I Present to you another town! As a follow up to St Bernard`s Hill i felt like i could do it better and bigger, so after 4 months of constant development I am proud to announce that St Paulo's Hammer is my biggest town yet! having more buildings than the entire region of St Bernard`s while being a little over half its size!
Though dont let that fool you into thinking that i just copy-pasted buildings all over the place and called it a day, this map is made of about 260 house variants alone and more!, with unique commercial and industrial buildings across the board, so i do hope that you will enjoy its rich variety and detailing!
General Info
