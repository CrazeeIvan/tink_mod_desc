This is the first map I've ever created, and with the exception of the farmhouse, all of the buildings are original designs. If there are any issues with anything map related, please let me know.
Special thanks to Ziggy for coming up with the idea for the map, and to Pertominus for being patient enough to teach me. Participation awards to Bob and Ney for playtesting.
