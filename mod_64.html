<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2762018937' target='_blank'>Mod 64</a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered why you can't get seeds for other food items such as Eggplants and Lettuce in the game? Well this fixes that.
This mod has no dependencies, just plug and play for 41.56+ If you want to get the seeds make your way to where you would normally find seeds(Farming goods store , or a warehouse such as McCoy's Logging).

To Do:
I will be working on new crops and their models next.
Additionally I will work on some localisations into other languages as well.
To be added:
1. Maybe seeds for rice, red peppers, broccoli, etc. Basically add all the regular crops that I forgot to add before.
2. Fruit trees: ex. Lemons, Oranges, Apples, Cherries, etc
