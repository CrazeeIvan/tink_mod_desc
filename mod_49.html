The original armor pieces were thick enough to deflect bullets, but zomboids were able to bite through them?
This also prevents all armor pieces from getting holes.
This tweak was built for my personal PvE server.
Planned: Minor forearm armor from shoulder and handplates, possibly a new armor piece.
