Important Changes
Removed Mod Options. Mod values can be configured in the sandbox options. I believe this approach is more balanced and fair. (See screenshot)
Because of this change, existing saves will revert to using default values (Min: 500, Max: 2000, Consider Traits: true, Consider Occupations: true). This is the only way to make saves backwards compatible.
Exhausted from your character always panicking when they see a zombie even though they slaughtered countless zombies? Then this mod is for you.
What It Does
After you kill 500 (Modifiable through Sandbox Options) zombies through melee or gun combat (no fire burns), you get the chance to become desensitized. This chance increases as you get more zombie kills.
If you reach 2000 (Modifiable through Sandbox Options) zombie kills, you automatically become desensitized.
Some traits and professions also change the chance that you'll become desensitized.
When you become desensitized, mutually exclusive traits will be removed (Cowardly, Agoraphobic, Claustrophobic, Hemophobic).
You have a chance to gain this trait at midnight (00:00).
Considered Traits that change the chance of gaining the trait
Postive: Brave, Hunter
Negative: Cowardly, Agoraphobic, Claustrophobic, Hemophobic, Pacifist
Considered Occupations that change the chance of gaining the trait
Police Officer, Fireman, Park Ranger, Security Guard, Doctor, Nurse
