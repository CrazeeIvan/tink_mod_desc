You can build a safe base in the beautifully decorated residential area, or seek shelter in the dog food canning factory surrounded by high walls. Oh, don't forget the westernmost pawnshop and the central commercial district, there will definitely be the loots you want inside. And there seems to be something hidden in the beautiful villa on the northeast side of the map. At the same time, a large number of zombies around it are also looking forward to meeting you!
I would like to express my special gratitude to @ throttlekitty @ Jungle Warlord @ Daddy Dirkie Dirk @ 欧金金.
I can't complete this map without the beautiful tiles package you made:D
