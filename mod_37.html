Zombie cures from the mod "They Knew" will now very rarely spawn in medical supplies such as hospitals.
Will not spawn in bathrooms, cabinets etc. ONLY in medical supplies, including secret labs and military camps
Item spawn rate details below.
- 7 times rarer than antibiotics on average.
- In military medical containers, 7 times rarer than beta blockers, antidepressants etc.
- In medical containers that strictly only store drugs, such as some found in hospitals, the spawn rate is 27 times rarer than antibiotics, because those containers have a much higher abundance of drugs
