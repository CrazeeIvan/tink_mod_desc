I am Woldren and this is my map: Over the River
The bridge has a town above it, as in Fallout 3.
Warning: place the generator on the roof, check the pictures above to see where it is.
The bridge is a giant building, so if you place it on the street, you'll receive damage, since the street is part of the building.
The bridge is connected to a ship, that has secret passages, secret rooms etc etc.
Through the ship you can reach the land on the other side of the river.
Cell 38x20 contains Walter White's house, from Breaking Bad.
Cell 38x19 contains a large military base.
Cell 39x20 contains a logging  factory.
Cell 39x19 contains Grove Street, from GTA San Andreas.
The military base contains a new hospital
Inside the base there is also an underground bunker full of loot.
if you don't see the changes after the update, in your current game, you could try to follow this little guide:
