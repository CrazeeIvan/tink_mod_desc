Can this be added to an existing save?
Yes, this can be safely added and removed from existing saves.
Does this work in Multiplayer?
Untested, but it should because this is just a modification to one client LUA function
Can I include this in a modpack?
Yes.
Are there known incompatibilities?
This mod hooks in to ISVehicleDashboard:prerender() and adds additional code after the function executes which means it should not cause issues with any other mods, as all original  code is executed.
This mod will not work if Better Speedometers is installed, because that mod completely replaces ISVehicleDashboard:prerender() instead of hooking additional functionality in as a  patch.
