I will not answer questions asked in the comments! If you have any questions, make a discussion here, an issue on github or a message on discord (modding channel of the official the indie stone discord or a pm).
I prefer here or github because like that people can use it back later if they have the same question.
I do not authorize the use of my CODE (copy paste) for modpacks. If you want it, ask it pls. But you can you use the mod for your mod or server if everyone is sub the this mod thx ! (Mod is different from code)
