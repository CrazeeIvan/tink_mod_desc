A small single cell map that I initially made in between two days for a private server. Now got the permission to release it for public.
It is located in a remote area, perfect for a starter base camp for a group of people. Has a community center, some shelter trailers, a church, some shops and storage units...
What else you need to return from a day of loot hunting and zed slaying?
Notice: "The Oasis Alpha" that is already uploaded to the Workshop by user amorunsit is the same map but used by the server admins.
The map is straight vanilla and uses no additional mods or tilepacks.
Located in cell 16,32 (connected to vanilla road map in cell 16,33)
No known conflicts.
