Credit for this issue to my friend who pointed it out, and this (below) fellow commenter on the Improvised Glass page.
What does it do?
Just adds Base.brokenglass to the list of accepted glass along with the Movable.brokenglass. Its a scripts file overwrite.
Load Order
Put this below the Improvised Glass mod so it loads after and overwrites.
