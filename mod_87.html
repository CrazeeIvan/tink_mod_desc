Or perhaps you dont have the budget for a motorhome and have a perfectly good Bulldriver sitting around?
Or you simply want 2 extra seats but dont want to take it back to be made into an extended cab?
Well if either of these above cases fit your situation in the slightest, our new 'Roamer' model is the RV for you!
Budget, rugged and able to fit plenty on it's rear cargo rack, its just the vehicle you need for those long trips you keep getting invited on.
Fits the vanilla game fairly well, during modelling i mostly kept to the style a lot of vanilla vehicles use to make sure it fits in well alongside both vanilla and modded vehicles
Comes with an optional patch that gives it an RV interior, RV interior mod itself can be found here
