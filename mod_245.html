<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804428637' target='_blank'>Mod 245</a></h2><p>My tilepack was originally designed to add tiles for my map mod Monmouth County, however, I am now started to add tiles for other map modders.
As of today I have added:
01/07/21: 1 Set of Bedroom furniture in 10 different colours
You can find the tilesheets in this modin the file location: bigzombiemonkeys_tiles_pack>media>Tilesheets (for Map Modders)
I will continue to add tiles to this pack for other map modders to use, all I ask is please give credit where it is due.
If you have any requests please leave them in the comments and I will see what I can do, just please keep in mind that I make tiles when inspiration hits me so if I choose not to make something it is nothing personal.
Thank you for all of the support.
