Adds new ways that clothing items can be worn such as: opening and rolling jackets/shirts, tying sweaters & hoodies, and tucking in pants.
This affects almost all vanilla jackets, sweaters, shirts, coveralls, and pants.
Opening a jacket or shirt will reduce its insulation. Rolling up sleeves will expose your forearms. Tying a sweater around your waist will only protect your lower body. Tucking in pants is only cosmetic.
Wearing jackets open and rolled at the same time will make skirts invisible, this is the only way I could get the clothing masks to work because of a bug in the game
It's fine to use and edit my assets for your own mods as long as you can credit me.
