This town sits on the western part of the Exclusion Zone, south of Riverside. Tall apartment buildings and wealthy suburbs await you, however be wary of its narrow alleyways and even narrower staircases, death will await you at every turn so be cautious with every step you take.
Pas mal non ? C'est fran√ßais.

This map conflicts with Wildberries, pick one of the two.
Some answers to frequently asked questions:
- (As of 03/05/24) Despite the many comments, this map works in multiplayer like any other up to date map and is set up like any other map, 100% of issues with Chestown not working in multiplayer are user side and not the fault of the mod itself, as evidenced by the 10s of thousands of people using it in multiplayer.
- Has a police station, multiple medical POIs, a pawn shop, a hardware store and a library, doesn't have a school, fire station, gun store or warehouses. The map will never be made bigger and will never have new buildings (school, bigger suburbs, etc.). Will
maybe
have basements once B42 comes out.
- Loot and vehicle zones all work fine and as expected, meaning that loot does spawn (and respawns according to your sandbox settings) as do cars.
- Zombie density is tied to the size/height of a building and mappers cannot change that, meaning that despite its small size, Chestown will always have a ton of zombies because of its many tall and dense buildings.
- Loot density: Same thing, tall and dense buildings mean lots of rooms to explore and lots of loot to get, if you think that's game breaking you should not play with this map.
- Too many guns: I don't know what causes this for some people. My playtests were fine. Sometimes it's added mods that mess up loot tables, sometimes it's the game itself that spawns too many guns in rooms that are connected to one another if one room is supposed to have a higher chance of spawning guns than others. If that's the case I can't do anything about it. I suspect it is more obvious in Chestown than in the vanilla map (or other modded maps) since a lot of buildings are connected to each other.
I will leave the older comments but going forward I will be deleting any new comments about these specific topics I just covered.
