Since the outbreak, the city populace has succumbed to the virus and its apartment buildings and abandoned shopping malls are now infested with Infected. The city's large size and abundance of loot make it a target for scavengers.
Some of the buildings in this map are custom creations heavily influenced by DayZ!
