Do you like medieval weapons and armor but only the historically accurate looking ones? If yes then this mod is the one for you.
With currently 13 new weapons, 2 armors and 2 helmets, this mod aims to add more historically accurate gear to the zombie apocalypse of zomboid.
As usual if you run into any issues with the mod or have suggestions please leave a comment down below.
BLACKSMITH MOD is not required to use this mod, it simply adds a way to craft the items, if you don't have the BLACKSMITH MOD you'll still be able to loot the weapons and armors from gunshops, pawnshops, etc.
