Ed's Auto Salvage
without overwriting / changing load order.
This started as a simple parking lot so I could learn how to create PZ maps. Now, its a respectable small town.
Most buildings used were included in the map editor and all credits go to those creators. But, some buildings I did create, like the hunting lodge.
There are plenty of spots with loot & building potential.
Unfortunately, I'm not very interested in making mods or maps for this game anymore, so last update may be with build 42 update. Thank you for all of the support! :spiffo:
This works with all popular map mods.
Please leave feedback and report issues/bugs. If you find this useful give it a like!
Fun Fact: I tried my best to model the gunstore to look like the Kiba gun store in Escape from Tarkov.
