Made for 41.60+
Q: Does it...
A: Yes it works in MP, yes it works with the new map, yes it works on any MP server rented or otherwise. No I am not going to help you with rented servers or MP servers in general.
Q: Could you...
A: No.
I wanted a central base location with a gas station nearby, there wasn't any so I made one!
- Centrally located
- It has it's own gas pump.
- Partially walled off. (high fence)
- It has plenty of space for all your cars and loot.
- There are no major zombie spawns nearby so a good place to hold out.
- Large 2nd floor with a big balcony. (Collect your water safely!)
- A variety of things for you to find.
It can be a very powerful start so I recommend spawning somewhere else and making your way over to Ed's.
Check here for a version WITHOUT a gas pump.
It goes very well with my other mod:
Little Township
There is also map mod next to Ed's made by Ammo Pack check it out:
Old Park Town
Trash Queen made a
plugin for the Eris Minimap!
Ed's Auto Salvage changes cell [29,28] and will not be compatible with other mods that change this cell. Anything else goes! ;)
The screen shots were made with car spawn setting high, just for some nice visuals. ;)
I made this for myself, so I may or may not update it, I may or may not fix any issues, no promises.
Requests to add or change anything will be largely ignored.
How to add to an existing game:
You can change the mod loadout of a save by clicking load instead of continue and there you can change the mods list for that save.
In addition if you already visited cell 29,28 you can follow the guide here:

Before you do this be sure to make a backup!!
Permissions:
Anyone may include or make it compatible with any other mod or modpack, go nuts!
