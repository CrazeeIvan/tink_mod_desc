It was initially modified shortly before the zombie outbreak of 1993, with the aim of hosting the upper classes of Louisville, in an epidemic that the governments already saw coming. Despite everything, the evacuation never took place, due to the speed with which the virus spread in the US.
In this map, which is my first, my intention was to create a completely self-sufficient, surviving city that could sustain itself without the need for any outside help.
FEATURES:
-Small city located east of Louisville, with little (almost none) zombie population. Ideal to start a game in Louisville, but without a lot of zombies at your door.
-Uses the tiles 49x11, 49x10, 49x9,50x9,51x9. (As far as I know dont interfere with any other map)
-Support with Ingame map and foraging areas.
-With spawn points in the city. (Customized by professions)
-Car spawn in the city
-Some secret buildings that do not appear on the map to be discovered
-It is fully compatible with the "Trimble County Power Station & La Grange" map, and it is recommended to play it with it.

IMPORTANT:
-If you have already visited the area, you will need to restart the game, or wipe the server for it to appear.
-All required mods are mandatory, without them many map tiles will be missing
-The mod has two versions, the original without zombies in the city, and one with normal population. If you want to put the one with zombie population you must choose that version in mods in the main screen, or use the second ID of the mod (for servers).
