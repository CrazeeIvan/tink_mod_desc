Because of its good location advantage and rich natural resources, it has become a tourist resort and a transit station for materials of McCoy Factory.
Because of the booming economy, the local service industry and public facilities are very complete, and you can experience the excellent service level in the community center here.
The people in the town live and work in peace and contentment and are friendly to outsiders.
However, after the disaster, the military blocked some of its roads,Let the whole town become hell on earth.
Now you're going to explore this town, aren't you?
This map has been completely updated, and now there are many more buildings made by myself. You can find good settlements on this map.
In the southeast corner of this map, I also set up a big maze, which will contain good loot!
This map occupies the Cell 27 * 32 28 * 32 27 * 33 28 * 33. When driving in these cells, be careful of obstacles on the road!
