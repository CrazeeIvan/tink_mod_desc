<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2685168362' target='_blank'>Mod 21</a></h2><p>This mod is intended for players who are confused about what effects each trait and profession has on the character.
It adds description to the traits that need it to describe their effects on the character in detail, instead of leaving people guessing with vague sentences. This way, players can have an easier time imagining their own builds by themselves.
It also adds the description on mouse hover in the character's info screen, in game. This works with descriptions of traits from other mods too, like Banjo's item kits or Dynamic traits for example.
This is based on a combination of my own knowledge, the game's non-exposed Java files (that I learned how to decompile),  the game's exposed Lua files,  your feedback, and the wiki of PZ.
Most of what I added in the traits' descriptions are in parenthesis so you can distinguish what is vanilla description and what is not.
If you notice a typo, or know of an effect that is not listed, or spot something that is wrong or poorly worded, please leave a comment to point it out to me. I don't think I got every single effect that could be listed, and I may have made a mistake somewhere, so I'm relying on you guys for that.
Compatibility
Works with build 41 and in multiplayer.
Compatible with:
Dynamic Traits
,
More Traits
,
Banjo's Item kits
,
More Simple Traits
...also
Driving Skill
,
Scavenger Skill
...
So it should be compatible with any mod that adds traits or skills.
Note:
I will not list any EXPLOIT or BUG that is clearly unintended as part of a trait or profession's effects. The issue with Weak Stomach has been noted, and I made a bug report to the devs. If they don't fix it, I will update the description to point out the unintended issue.
For those who want to know, the issue with Weak Stomach is
it makes food illness last shorter instead of longer. (not as short as Irong Gut though)

Foraging stats:
The mod details the foraging stats bonuses for each trait and profession.
Stats are : Foraging radius bonus, Weather Effect reduction, and Darkness Effect reduction and also Specialisation bonuses for every foraging category.
All foraging stats are added dynamically, which means any balance changes will be automatically updated, and other traits that get foraging stats in their descriptions (if they have foraging stats).

Character Info Screen Tooltip:
The mod displays the detailed description of each trait in the character's info screen window on mouse hover. Works for professions too (except Unemployed since it doesn't have an image).
Works with traits of other mods too! Although their descriptions probably won't be as detailed.
