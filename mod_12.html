M911 was the workhorse of US Armed forces for decades, his last job was to transport M1 Abrams tanks to battlefield. It's huge, it's ugly and it's one of the most iconic semi-trucks ever made. It comes in normal, armored and burnt flavor, with many texture variations.
All variants include:
Fully animated
- They all come with 3d custom parts, animations and craftable armor
Run-flat Tires
- They will run even when damaged, but with reduced friction
Central tire inflation system
- Monitors tire pressure, if it gets too low, it pumps it back up just like in rl
Lightbar
- Make a distraction with some light and sound effects
Trunk
is divided in 2 compartments (it's not huge, but you can organize your gear)
Spare tire
Gas tank
is armored
Military Semi-Trailers
(USMC Green, NATO Green, Desert Tan and Woodland camo)
M126 Stake Semi-Trailer
M127 Van Semi-Trailer
M128 Van Semi-Trailer
M747 Lowbed Semi-Trailer
M967 Fuel Tanker Semi-Trailer
(Requires

Trailers are NOT towable by normal vehicles, only M911, but the M911 can also tow normal trailers, M911 is not compatible with other semi mods, they use different connection method.
You attach the trailer by aligning the truck under the trailer just like in the pictures above, exit, press v and select + from radial menu just like with normal trailers.
