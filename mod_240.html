This is a submod of the main map "Fort Knox linked to Eerie Country"
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2595249356
It's a road that connects Fort Knox to Bedford Falls.
It overwrites 6 cells, south of Bedford Falls that are currently forests.
The Cells are: 45x38, 45x39, 45x40, 45x41, 45x42, 45x43
You'll need to activate this mod only if you want to play with Fort Knox
and Bedford Falls and if you want a road between them instead of a forest.
Of course you can also decide to not use this mod, and walk
through the forest, but if you have a car, you'll need it.
In order to use this mod you'll need to activate the main mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2595249356
and of course Bedford Falls
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=522891356
The mod load order needs to be Road, Fort Knox, Bedford Falls. This map will not work if you don't have this load order.
