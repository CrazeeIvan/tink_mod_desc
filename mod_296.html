Ah.. you wanna play with cars but you lack experience.
You've come to the right place.
How to ?
Get a Screwdriver, a Wrench, a Lug Wrench and a Jack.
Ensure you've read the book associated with your car.
Find a car you can spare, and just start training with serenity.
On vehicle mechanics menu, right click any mounted part and left click on Train Mechanics button.
Mod Options
When using the awesome
ModOptions
, you'll have access to
these options
.
Verbose options are logs that reduce (a lot) performances: only for debug analysis.
If your character does not reinstall desinstalled parts: increase the "Delay between actions".
You can select a threshold for uninstall attempts depending on risks of breaking the part.
You can use or not a pause at the end of all actions (e.g. when using time speed increase for a full training).
You can re-try vanilla Uninstall and Install actions until they succeed.
Sandbox Options
You can enfore the failure threshold server side in multiplayer.
The lowest (most limiting) value between the client value (mod option) and the server value (sandbox option) is used.
It is 0 by default.
Tips and Tricks
Remember there is no need to train more than once a day (per car).
You can increase game speed in solo mode.
A mismatch between client and server with B41 Multiplayer?

.
The training can reach a stall due to pathfinding. Keep a lot of free space around the car to avoid this.
Broken items will be dumped. (items you uninstalled and cannot reinstall will not be. e.g. a tire will not be reinstalled nor dropped if the suspension is broken and dropped)
Make sure to disable re-equipment before "Train Mechanics" if you're using the
Tidy Up Meister
mod.
This mod can be added to or removed from any save (both MP and solo).
Project Zomboid gives much freedom to players and modders, but there are tricky stuff I will not explain a thousand times in the comments below.
