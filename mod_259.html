Tiles will also be used in other mods I am working on.
Thanks @Miss Raptor

for providing your beautiful art so I can integrate them into my builds and tiles!
For server owners: You can use my tiles on your server and also create your own mod pack with it, to avoid too frequent updates as long as you do not change anything and give credit.
For modders/map creators: If you want to use my tiles in your mods or maps, you can do so as long as you give credit.
Thank you @Erin Azakaela Redfire for allowing me to use your Mount Aza tiles to make blends with my quarry tiles!
Also a big thank you to @throttlekitty for allowing me to use a couple of your tiles to incorporate them into my junk walls!
Thank you also to Zubludok for the amazing consoles, one of which I used for my industrial metal smelter as well as the power switch.
For the amazing cave tiles, I thank Skizot a ton and I used them as inspiration to create additional tiles for the caves contained in my tile set.
Credits for the gore tiles go to

that I used to combine and make more.
