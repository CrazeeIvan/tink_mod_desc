This is my first Tileset, it started as a personal thing for a map i have been working on but since some people were interested over on discord, i decided to post these for public use!
Feel free to use the tileset on your maps! just credit me plox :)
Theres also 2 extra tile types that i havent mentioned on the images, diagonal walkway stripes, the reason for that is that they are kind of ugly in my opnion, but its there in case you like it.
*yeah uhm, to be honest i dont know much about street marks, but as far as ive seen this helps it looks prettier and more like something youd see in real life
Like what i do?
