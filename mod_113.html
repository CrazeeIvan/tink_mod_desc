STUFF NOT WORKING? COMPATIBILITY ISSUES?
Should be fully compatible with saves in progress and safe to remove mid game in progress too. Works in multiplayer just fine.
Currently has incompatibility issues with "Improved Build Menu [Build 41]" by Vaileasys. You can try using "Improved Build Menu + Extra Buildings" by FallenTemplar instead. Also can openers suffer a mod conflict when using the "Moar Can Openers" mod by NoctisFalco.
If you're finding certain weapons in this mod having missing functions, it could be because of a mod conflict or incompatibility. Try this mod:
Item Tags Compatibility Patch
by opsedar. It's a useful patch mod that helps a variety of mods work better together!
As always, a special thanks to my friend
Cosmic
for his help with understanding
the codebase of this game, as well as being fully responsible for the Defiler / Despoiler Switch Stance ability. His workshop is
here,
check it out!
Also thanks to
Authentic Peach
helping me with adding custom sounds to the mod. Their
workshop
is that way, take a look!
Note:
My knowledge of coding can be written on the back of a postage stamp, with room to spare. I don't even know where to begin to make mods compatible with other mods, so any requests for compatibility are likely to be futile. Sorry about that. :(
Note:
Please don't post my mods anywhere else or add them to other mods without seeking permission first, and please credit me when / where credit is due. Thanks!
