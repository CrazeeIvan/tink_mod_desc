<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967216697' target='_blank'>Mod 152</a></h2><p>Near Rosewood, there is a Rest Area calles the Exotics. a small comercial stop to rest and buy non common stuff.
contains:
- army surplus store
- Saloon
- Pawn shop
- a hidden room
- a easy to defend house with garage and a lake
me and my friend like to spawn in rosewood to conquer fort redstone and ravencreek.
but we dont like the fact that there is no pawnshop or a army surplus (at leat one that respawns)
we also like the house in luisville at the river. so i reimagined it to our liking
