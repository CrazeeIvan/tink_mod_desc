Make sure you have
"Double-sized Textures"
on in your Display settings when using such tile packs or any mods possibly overriding vanilla tiles.
For All
: Be advised, if you have any of the 4 maps subscribed. This bundle
MIGHT HAVE CONFLICT
with the 4 maps above and occurs unknown consequences. Although I haven't met any as of today with all of these installed. If you happened to witness any, please inform me below. And if you have all the 4 maps installed, there's no need to subscribe this anymore.
For Players
: You only need this if you've downloaded a custom map that requires this mod.
For Modders
: This is a bundle for those who wants to use the tiles from these 4 maps without the complete installation of those maps. Basically made for modders. So the players won't have to subscribe the 4 maps if they don't want to. And your
mod.info
needs to have this line: require=dylanstiles_bundle
If you use the tiles in your map make sure on the mod steam page you make it a requirement to use this mod.
