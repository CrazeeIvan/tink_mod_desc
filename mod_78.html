Wanna help make a cleaner apocalypse?
Try out the "Let's Get Wasted Managment" truck
Base truck model by Filibuster Rhymes from his mod
Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars!
Animations by Mr.Macbeth
If you use the radial menu (V) on the truck when you have items in the back,
you can destroy them forever! if the back is at least HALF full, you will get
a trash cube(tm) to spawn. VBe wary of putting corpses back there as they will make
pretty meaty cubes.
