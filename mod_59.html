<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879960936' target='_blank'>Mod 59</a></h2><p>SORRY, BUT I AM NOT MAINTAINING THIS MOD ANYMORE, SINCE I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MANY HOURS TRYING TO FIND BUGS. IF SOMEONE CAN FIX THE CODE AND SEND IT TO ME I WILL UPDATE THE MOD, BUT OTHERWISE, I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING.
Will show players on a map and minimap, since the original mod "Players On Map" stopped working.
This mod is not compatible with the original mod "Players On Map", so only one mod should be enabled. If you are still getting errors then try deleting the original mod.
If mod is not working or loading, then just try disabling all other mods and checking again. If it works then there is some conflicting mods.
Writing that something doesn't work will not help me to fix it, Before writing it, try to understand why and when it does not work. And if there are errors then send them from console.txt.

I AM DISABLING THE COMMENT SECTION
, because there are too many people, who complain that something is not working, without providing me enough information, so I could fix it. If you want to help me fix issues from now on you can add me as a friend on
