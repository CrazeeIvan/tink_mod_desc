Customizable Kill Rating for your server
About this mod
This mod adds a zombie kill rating for players. This mod was written for the server "The15karatPZ". It solved the main problem of other similar mods - microfreezes in players, during the rating update. Now the table is formed on the server side and given to the players in ready form.

4) Frequency of refreshing the table at the player* (1 - 10 minutes, 2 - 1 hour, 3 - a day.)
*Options 3-4 apply only after restarting the server
