<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2384329562' target='_blank'>Mod 261</a></h2><p>This is a collection of world tile sprites I've made to be used as a resource in creating custom maps. Some sprites may have additional functionality, I'll be including lua for those in this mod as needed. I don't plan on making anything here craftable, however.
Currently supports b41.xx IWBUMS
For Players: You only need this if you've downloaded a custom map that requires this mod.
For Modders: Editor tilesheets are found in the in my google drive, place them in your Tiles\2x\ folder with the others.
I've included my own copy of BuildingFurniture.txt. This goes in %userprofile%\.TileZed\
You may want to make a backup of that file first, my copy includes many fixes for the building editor objects as well as adding my own tiles.

Your mod.info needs to have this line: require=tkTiles_01
Be aware that this is a work in progress, I won't try to break maps with updates, just know that it can happen if I need to make changes that do. If tile positions in this mod change, check out the TileZed lua scripts, there are examples of how to swap a tile instance with another.
Anyone is free to use or modify anything in this mod for their own, I just ask to be credited, no need to ask me directly. Have fun with them!
