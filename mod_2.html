<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2945221351' target='_blank'>Mod 2</a></h2><p>This mod adds onto
Mod Manager
and
Mod Manager: Server
to make the mod load order window much more bearable to use. By adding the options to move mods at greater increments, it reduces the number of clicks you need to move through those big modlists you have.
Requires the
main mod
to work.
HEY YOU, COMMENTING ABOUT A NEEDED FEATURE
IM NOT A UI WIZARD - I NEED HELP BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW THIS CRAP WORKS! I'VE GOT NO TIME BETWEEN A DEGREE AND A JOB FOR FIGURING IT OUT! THATS WHY I UPDATE LIKE EVERY OTHER MONTH
Please consider helping me out, or commissioning some basement dweller, or figuring it out on your own, or something.
Future Plans
If you really want another feature to this doinky 30-minute mod I made, then don't solely rely on me to do it and contribute something. Every little bit helps.
People want a search bar, because apparently one isn't enough. I'd never use it, but why not do it anyway? BUT, long story short, things go KABLAM and BOOM and I need someone experienced with this game's UI to help me figure out how to "dim" the list elements darker, with opacity or something. I'll probably look into it myself once I get back to modding during a long vacation, but your help might make this thing happen faster!

Compatible with every mod
Only functions in main menu (multiplayer & save-game irrelevant)
