Hey dudes, I quit my job, learned to animate with blender and I've been working on a pretty darned big update for the mod over the last few months!
When I'm done, the mod will have...
Fully animated vehicles WITH interiors, engines, even radios!
Over 50 base vehicle models
Over 100 variants, such as sedans, coupes, convertibles, station wagons, taxis, police, offroad versions of trucks, etc.
Over 5 trailers!!! (...so like 6, haha)
A few more removable parts, like bumpers and roofs, but still keeping with the vanilla spirit!
A lot of bug fixes.
A lot of new bugs, probably.
I've been living off my savings and treating the mod like a full time job, but I'm pretty close to the point where I'll need to get a paying job, haha.
I really hate asking for donations, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get this totally finished up in time. If any of you guys are in a pretty good spot money wise, anything you guys toss my way will help me get more of this finished. If you don't have a lot or just don't feel comfortable donating, that's fine! I don't want you guys feeling guilty because you can't or even don't want to.
I've got a Patreon and a buymeacoffee below! Also discord, for good measure.

A few people are still reporting the mod for the picture, oopsies! If the links are hidden, my name on both is

. Just give that a search, homie. The donation pages also have a link to my discord.
Credits
Fenris Wolf
helped out a boatload, especially with getting the old .40 version running. It probably still woulda happened, but it'd be a lot more sloppy, have unnecessary vanilla code and be less compatible.
You guys have
PlanetAlgol
to thank for the fuel truck code, and so do I! Now you guys can fulfill your survival compound fantasy.
And obviously
The Indie Stone
for helping modders out, like by adding some tools to make things a hell of a lot easier and makin' the dang game in the first place, haha.
