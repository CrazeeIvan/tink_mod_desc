17.01.2024
changed requirements for walls and recipe for glass panel. If you use Improvised Glass Mod you will see only requirements for walls changed
25.09.2023
Updated the mod with glass panels from
Improvised Glass mod by Orc
. I imported them in cut version: only panels and their craft recipes.
These panels are now
required
to build glass walls and roofs. They can be found in "Random Junk Crates" or can be made by smelting broken glass in roasting pan in any stove or grill.
Improvised Glass mod isn't necessary for Greenhouses to work
NOTE! If you use Improvised Glass mod make sure that it would be loaded AFTER my mod!
Details:
Can be found under Carpentry menu.
4 main colors: white, brown, green and black.
Flat roofs are required to make your greenhouse count as "indoors" an be rainproof. First place flat roofs and then ordinary ones. There are 2 levels of flat roofs, you need lower one for 'sealing' the house. All roofs should be placed from the second floor,
not from the ground
.
There are fences and curbs to separate your plants from other tiles.
Fences
need to be placed before digging a furrow,
curbs
- after. In other way you will get ugly tile overlapping.
Based on More Builds code, doesn't conflict with it.
ABOUT MODPACKS and other usage:
do whatever you want, just credit original mod in description. If you edit my mod or add it to modpack
pls change Mod ID
, so users will have no conflicts in future in case of any updates.
