Model is kinda low poly because this is the model I used on my Ravenfield weapon mod. Also its supposed to be a testing weapon if Custom Weapon animations are possible in this game and it turns out to be a "Yes".. And yes if you are skeptic it has custom reload animations (Not that kind of a CODMW19 Parkinsons Reload though).
Item List:
- Whitworth Rifle
- Hex Ammunition
- Paper Cartridge
The weapon can be found on Gun Shops,  Weapon Stashes, Metal Lockers, Wardrobes, and again a very very low possibility spawning inside school lockers.. You can't call it america when no guns spawning inside school lockers.
You can't attach stuff on it atm..
Ammunition can be craftable.. By looking for stone, chipstone, or a metal scrap and make it a hexagon round with knives or another chipstone, then look for a piece of paper and salvage the gunpowder out of live ammunition and congrats! You got yourself a paper cartridge and the Whitworth is ready to fire!
Ammunition can be found via Gun Shops and Weapon Stashes aswell..
