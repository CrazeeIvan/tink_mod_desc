<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901328637' target='_blank'>Mod 253</a></h2><p>This is a collection of tile sprites I have made with some focus on roleplay use. Some of the tiles have been given additional functional properties. This tile collection is an active work in progress. Tiles currently included may be changed or altered slightly as updates occur.
Some neat details on the tile properties:
You can crouch in the tall grass and gain a slight sneaking bonus!
Jogging in the corpse pit slows characters while sprinting in the corpse pit will result in falling. Who knew corpses weren't stable running platforms?! Can vault over road block tiles.
Feel free to use the tiles in any map so long as credit is given. Do not redistribute or edit these tiles without my written permission.
