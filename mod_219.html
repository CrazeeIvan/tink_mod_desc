Cell 41,21. No known conflicts. But I will add any to the description if they are found.
Situated between West Point and on the road up to Louisville.

The Frigate is worth visiting as it contains weapons and military items, though be careful... the tight corridors below the decks make it a hazardous place to visit.
Recommended mod-
Choose to spawn on the Frigate and then the Insurgent Profession for a great play through starting point.
Thank you to all the tile makers, the mapping discord peoples and especially SimonMD who elevated this mod to the next level! Thank you also to Spoon for naming the Frigate!
