A generally quiet river town, Rabbit Hash is known for its iconic General Store. Here, you will find all manner of goodies to help you out on your journey along the rural route to Louisville.
Rabbit Hash is a real-world location in KY, although it has been displaced a bit geographically and now finds itself a fair ways down the river from its former home.
Map Features:

🏪 A really cool general store with custom tiles for the sign
⛵ A variety of docks & other infrastructure to support your boating habits
👮‍♀️ A Police Station
Technical Stuff:
Rabbit Hash and its particular geometry and layout seemed to fit well into the chosen cells & surrounding road system. I feel like the map does a decent job of filling in some dead space between Riverside & West Point.
This is our first map & as such it only uses the vanilla tiles (aside from the awesome sign). The map may have some errors, feel free to comment and I'll do my best to fix anything. You may also feel that the loot is too heavy or light as I built a majority of the buildings as I went, so feel free to voice any bugs/loot/etc issues as well. Expect semi-frequent updates early on as I finish refining & polishing the map after some play-testing.
Compatibility:
So far, the only map I've found that Rabbit Hash conflicts with is North Peak. The cell is included in that map, but isn't used. Simply load Rabbit Hash before North Peak and both maps should work fine.
Like the map? Please show your support, it helps a lot!
