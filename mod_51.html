is an inventory mod that allows you to customize the order in which containers and backpacks appear in the inventory.
Simply drag and drop the container icons to rearrange them to your liking.
They'll even remember their preferred order if you drop the backpack and re-equip it later.
You also have the option to rearrange containers in the loot window,
but you need to turn it on using the options at the bottom of the loot window (next to the lock)
Lastly, you can manually set the sorting priority for containers if you need to. Just select the container and click the options icon at the bottom right of the window (next to the lock)
The drag and drop system will automatically handle the sorting priority by default.
