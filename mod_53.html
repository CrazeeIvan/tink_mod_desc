Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting

BOTH

I cannot see the sandbox settings tab for Random Zombies
The mod needs to be enabled at the main menu for the UI to update (main menu -> Mods, between Options and Workshop)
I'm getting an annoying popup window
This is most likely due to a misconfiguration. Please make sure you read the
How to customize spawn rates and update rate
section above. If you're still having issues, check the actual error messages in your console.txt file or comment below with a link to your console.txt file (it can be found at C:\Users\(yourname)\Zomboid\console.txt, or ~/Zomboid/console.txt on macOS and Linux).
I am not seeing the exact number of sprinters I configured
There is a random component to the algorithm, but the probability distribution has been tested to be accurately represented (in the limits of what computers can do, i.e. pseudo-randomness). If you notice a consistent large disparity, please check for conflicts with other mods. If you're still having issues, please run `BLTRandomZombies.fullCheck()` in your Lua console in Debug mode and comment below with a link to the 5 generated files (placed in C:\Users\(yourname)\Zomboid\Lua, or ~/Zomboid/Lua on macOS and Linux).
Do I need to set
Zombie Lore Speed
to
Random
?
No, the mod will overwrite zombie speed regardless of that setting.
What is the Frequency parameter?
Because of how the game works (modability, zombie recycling, etc.), Random Zombies has to check at regular intervals if the zombies are properly configured. Frequency allows you to choose how often RZ should do the check. In practice, the default setting (7500) works really well and you should not have to worry about it.
Can you allow the customization of strength, sight, memory as well?
Unfortunately, there's no way to do that that I know of today.
Is this mod compatible with Night Sprinters?
Yes, thanks to TheIlluminati!
Enjoy!
