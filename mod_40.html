What does this do?
A car armor mod that covers every vanilla vehicle, every Fili's vehicle and the Petyarbuilt379.
You should not
enable submods for vehicle mods you are not using.
Missing dependencies are normal.
To craft the items:
There are magazines that can be found in the world, read them to learn the respective recipes required for upgrades:
- Vanilla upgrades - "Magazine «Autotsar Tuning Atelier - Standard Models»"
- Fili upgrades - "Magazine «Autotsar Tuning Atelier - Advanced Models»"
- Petyarbuilt upgrades - "Magazine «Autotsar Tuning Atelier - Petyarbuilt 379»"
- Some recipes require for you to have read some of the vanilla vehicle repair magazines (auto manuals).
Regarding Existing Saves:
Enable the "Zombie Items" submod in your save. Some zombies will rarely drop the magazines. They can be dropped by mechanic, metalworker, construction, redneck, militia, raider, and survivor zombies.
