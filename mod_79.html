The latest blog post by The Indie Stone

seems to hint that they will add a fuel-side indicator to the vanilla game on Build 42.
I'm so happy that the developers noticed this small UI/UX tweak enough to warrant it to be in the base game. It has always been my intention to make this mod in the hopes of getting it implemented in vanilla.
Cheers to all who have supported this mod and I'm sure it will still come handy until B42 comes out.
Also,
This mod still works even though it's been over a year since I updated it. Works for Build 41.78+
Build 41.68 Patch
- Fixed error with Agrotsar Tractor*
- Fixed compatibility with two-wheeled vehicles**
**For some bikes, the mod makers made it so that you could refuel on both sides, in this case I have disabled the indicator.
*You may also find that the indicator does not appear in certain vehicles, this is because the mod makers have done some weird stuff on their vehicles that hinders this mod to get info on the gas tank location. One example of this is the Agrotsar Tractor that does not have a gas tank area which this mod relies on.
This mod should be loaded LAST. Specifically, after enabling other vehicle mods.
For server owners, place FSI at the end of the list of mods or after other vehicle mods.
Description
Find it annoying to turn your vehicle around in a gas station and attracting MORE zombies? Do you wish there was a way to know which side your car's gas tank is at?
Fuel Side Indicator
is a simple addition to your vehicle's dashboard that lets you know which side you have to park your car when refuelling!
Author's Notes
This is my first UI mod! Please be patient with any bugs you may encounter and report them in the comments below.
- No need for a new save, just enable it and you're ready
- To disable, just disable the mod itself
Big thanks to the PZ discord modding community! Special shout out to Shurutsue as well!
COMPATIBILITY: Build 41.78+
*Compatible with ALL vehicle mods! (as long as the vehicle has wheels)
*If you have a mod that tweaks the vehicle dashboard, this mod
may
conflict with it but not likely if it's a minor tweak.
MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBILITY:
* This should work since this is a client-side mod. Let me know down in the comments if you have trouble with the mod on your server.
REPACKING is ALLOWED.
Just credit me and don't whine at me when something breaks when you repack.
