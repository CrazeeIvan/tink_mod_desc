ModID: ItemTweakerAPI
--EDIT 2--
For those of you who are -still- getting missing file errors, Unsubscribe from the other item tweaker here.

Having both versions subscribed list alone can cause issues, as they are using the same ModID, and is 100% confusing your game's mod enabling/loading attempts.
This alone is making it try to load both my still working code, and the outdated version's now broken code.
Furthermore, if this issue is still happening, and you know you haven't subscribed to this mod, then there may be another mod you've subscribed to that is still using the outdated mod's script files.
I recommend looking into which those are, and suggest those mods switch back to this still working version.
---EDIT---
It's come to my attention that there is another version of item tweaker that had been updated at one point. While it may have been an improvement at one point, and I thank him for trying to keep this mod alive, his version is apparently causing many issues in the new build. This version seems to still work very well.
I have not been modding for PZ in quite a long time, however knowing this mod still works now as it did before makes me feel glad to have been part of the modding community. Should this start acting up for real, I may pass it on to someone more active, but as of now, I hope you continue to enjoy it. Thank you again Brybry and Blindcoder for helping to make improved mod compatability possible all these years
---ORIGINAL POST---
This modding API allows any modders to make multiple changes to any items loaded into the game's current database, while leaving the rest of the remaining values alone.
Change any item's weight, display name, display category, hunger reduction, or anything else, while keeping the item as mod friendly as possible.
(WARNING: changing TYPE will delete all instances of already spawned items)
You can change only an item icon, while another mod changes the same item's weight, all without conflict (Unless mods do not use this mod to do so, or two mods try to change the same value, in which case, the last loaded mod will win)
For the Simplest Implementation through LUA:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------Begin File
if getActivatedMods():contains("ItemTweakerAPI") then
require("ItemTweaker_Core");
else return end
TweakItem("Base.Needle","Icon", "Worm");
TweakItem("Base.Needle","Tooltip", "Wearable: Waist");
TweakItem("Base.Needle","DisplayCategory", "Repair");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------End File
For each item and property you wish to change, create a new line, and place the related values in place.
You can even add custom ModData to items.
TweakItem("Base.Needle","BaseValue", "500");
Organized Item Names is an example mod to hopefully show beginner modders how to make use of this API
