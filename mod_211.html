>>> NOTICE:
If you are are on top floor in the large church, DON'T walk through the wall that looks like a door. Its a bug and will lead to falling to death!!! <<<
This map is a work in progress but one cell is already finished and ready to play. This cell is part of the Mapjam Contest 2023 hosted by the Unofficial PZ Mapping Discord BUT is uploaded in two versions. THIS version contains the clean town cell WITHOUT the barricaded fallen colony theme.
To play this map WITH the fallen colony theme just submit to and load Shortrest Mapjam Version.
In future this town will be expanded into the sourrounding area and will be uploaded as new standalone expansion. So you safely can play this map without the fear of losing progress.
It has connection to vanilla road grid in cell 44,22. (Conflicts with Vardell Motor Speedway in this cell)
NOTIFICATION:
When unable to play map because EN_flags is missing, try to submit to it via this steam link:
