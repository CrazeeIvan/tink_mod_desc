This is the finished version of my first map, "
West Point VHS Store
".
There is no VHS store in West Point, so this mod adds one that is nearby, next to a trailer park.
The map features :
-
A trailer park
,
-
A VHS store
,
-
A convenience store
,
-
A farmer's market
,
-
A fairly isolated trailer home
,
-
Two farms
,
-
And a dirt path through the forest
.
It is located in the cell 38 x 24, South of West Point's Pizza Whirled and Zipee Market, right by the road that leads to the crossroads between Dixie and West Point.
