<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922087098' target='_blank'>Mod 208</a></h2><p>Since Rosewood is missing a VHS store and a guns store, this mod adds one of each, south of Rosewood.
The VHS store is right next to the southern gas station, with an appartment on the second floor.
The gun store is quite isolated in the woods, and to get inside, you'll need a sledgehammer.
There is no spawn point to directly spawn there. Just spawn in Rosewood and head south.
Zombie density is slightly increased compared to vanilla.
The cell used is 27x40.
