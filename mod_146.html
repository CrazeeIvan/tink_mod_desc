EXPANSION:
Introducing the
Addictions & Withdrawals Mod!
Now you can gain and lose both the "Smoker" and "Stoner" traits respectively -- depending on how often you smoke tobacco and cannabis!
🚭It can take several weeks or more to stop smoking.
🚭It takes nearly as long for non-smokers to pick up the habit.
🚭Smokers that have kicked the habit can pick it up again easily.
🧠Habitual use of marijuana can take just as long for tolerances to kick in, and wear off.
🧠The severity of marijuana use can effect this timeline.
🍀The traits "Lucky" and "Unlucky" can shorten or lengthen the time it takes for either user.
🍻 Alcoholism can be acquired and lost depending on alcohol consumption.
💅🏽
This mechanic is purely optional and can be disabled in the mods list.
NOTE:
Green Fire Mod
must
be enabled for Addiction Mod to work properly.

TRAITS:
🌲"Stoner" (2 points) - Players with the "Stoner" trait do not feel increased hunger or sleepiness from smoking weed, but must smoke more for the same positive effects.
🍷 "Alcoholic" (-3 points) - Alcoholics have a higher tolerance to alcohol, but become anxious when they haven't had a drink.

*HydroCraft is known to cause vanilla farming and farming in GreenFire to break, sometimes crashing the game. It is unknown when the HC devs will resolve this issue.
**Quit Smoking takes precedence over the Addictions & Withdrawals mod (ie: The time it takes to lose the Smoker trait is changed if you enable Quit Smoking).
***Dynamic Traits' version of Alcoholic takes precedence over Green Fire's version of the trait, but Addiction & Withdrawals' version of the Smoker trait takes precedence over DT's version.
****Because of the order that PZ loads mods in, and because of the way LGR is coded, a separate patch that is loaded after LGR is required:

NOTE:
Cannabis relieves boredom, unhappiness, and anxiety. A sedative effect occurs when cannabis is smoked, so do not operate heavy machinery while under the influence. Cannabis is also an excellent pain reliever and panic reducer.
