The mod adds new symbols to the map. Also divides them into categories.
Vanilla
Marks / Numbers
Weapons
Tools
Cars / Car Tools / Car Parts
Signs
Furnitures
Foods
Medicines
Craft
All
Maybe there will be more categories.
Compatibility.
Works with saves. You can turn on at any moment of the game. (You don't need to start a new game).
Works in multiplayer.
Adapts to any display resolution.
In theory, a mod should be compatible with any other mod. (Except those that change the map interface.)
Works with mods:
Map Symbol Size Slider
4 Color Bic Pen
Draw on the map
Map Legend UI
Extra Map Symbols UI
Does not work with mods:
Share Annotations - Some users have interface bugs.
(((( Attention ))))
Can help if something is wrong with the interface after updating the mod.
Enter the game --> Disable mod "Add More Map Symbols (AMMS)" --> Exit the game --> Unsubscribe from the mod "Add More Map Symbols (AMMS)" --> Wait 1 min. --> Subscribe again (Wait for it to load) -> Enter the game --> Enable the mod "Add More Map Symbols (AMMS)"
You can change the number of character columns in the sandbox settings. In a multiplayer game, all players will be affected.
PS
- If possible, I will add something new, if you need any more symbols or have a wish, write in the comments.
