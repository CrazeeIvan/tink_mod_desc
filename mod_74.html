Nightscale's Standardized Vehicle Upgrades!
Originating from the videogame BeamNG.Drive, the Ibishu Covet was Ibishu's first ever attempt of catering their Japanese automobiles to the American market. Designed specifically with the intentions of going against the likes of the Chevalier Dart, the Covet manages to surpass the competition thanks to its incredible versatility. It sold like wildfire across the entire contiguous nation, being the perfect car for anyone who just needed a commuter car back and forth that wouldn't break the bank. Despite only being produced in the states from 1986 to 1992, a fair number of these little buggers can still be found brand new, having been vastfully oversupplied for the country.
Retailed Models:
1.5 Dx:
The absolute baseline trim of the Covet. Designed specifically to be so utterly cheap and basic that it pushes the absolute limits of what the U.S. could federally allow at the time. The end result was this glorified armchair-on-wheels, featuring the bare bones of what a car can do, and an engine so unbelievably basic that you'd have a harder time understanding how to detach the car's door than to disassemble the engine. On the upside though, it was one of the last vehicles you could buy new for under 7,000$. Expect to find this car amongst anyone living directly at the poverty line, either just needing a car to get from place to place, or your local crackhead who likely stole it from an impound lot.
1.5 Dxi:
This was what Ibishu called their 'Standard Line', being the single most popular trim of the whole Covet fleet. It had some vehicle comforts, as well as a slightly improved engine that is instead fuel injected rather than carbureted. This resulted in better mileage, power, and overall reliability, at the cost of not being as mechanic-friendly as what the 1.5 Dx offered. Expect to find this car literally anywhere, from grocery stores to rental car lots, from the blue collar to the white collar.
1.5 Lxi:
The Lxi was designed to be Ibishu's more premium trimline of hatchbacks, featuring an entirely overhauled appearance to let it stand apart from its conventional counterparts. Although it was originally intended for businessmen who were fuel-conscious during its design phase of the early to mid 1980s, by the time of its debut, the 1986 Oil Glut hit the states, letting you go back to driving six litre V8s again with little repercussions to your wallet. This didn't interfere with the sales of the Lxi too much though, as it was found to be quite a very popular car amongst retirees who wanted a timid, practical car that wouldn't scare them. It was a fair tradeoff, but as a result a decent number of these vehicles had already begun to start rotting away on many used car lots, barely having been driven at all as a result.
1.5 Zxi:
With the Zxi being Ibishu's first step into the 'hot hatch' market, it was certainly a milestone for the company as this was unveiled. Its high-performance, dual overhead camshaft engine allowed it to propel much, much more quicker than the rest of its competitors, and was even able to stand its ground against many of America's newest vehicles thanks to just how light it was. This newfound performance did mean that it was much more harder to maintain such an exotic motor, but it didn't stop the public from buying it. This model was found to be quite popular to either the upper class who were in the process of having a midlife crisis but didn't want to splurge on a Cossette, or the trailerpark pimp that likely bought it under a massive pile of credit card debt trying to show off.
1.5 Zxi Special Edition:
For the state of Kentucky, this was Ibishu's top-of-the-line model of their entire range. It was the only one out of the lot that actually had alloy wheels compared to the steel hubs of all the others, as well as a sleek livery that stretched all around the car. It's engine was more beefier, the suspension more stiffer, and the exhaust more louder. It was so illustrious that this specific model wasn't even sold alongside its standard Zxi counterpart, you had to order it directly from Ibishu through a physical catalogue that would get shipped directly to you from Japan. This did make it quite an expensive vehicle, but its downsides hardly mattered for those who could afford this machine.
