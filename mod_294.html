Features
25 spray paint colors
white paint + 7 tinting paints to mix any color
vehicle sanding and priming
spray and tinting paint catalogues
Only civilian vehicles
from the vanilla game and supported mods can be painted.
How To
Before you paint vehicles you need to learn how to do that. Read Autostyle Magazine - Vehicle Painting: volume 1 teaches how to paint vehicles, volume 2 - how to mix paint. Mechanics (or any other) skill doesn't matter.
Then you need to do the following:
Wash your car if it's dirty.
Uninstall all windows from it.
Sand vehicle:
remove old paint and rust. Requires Wire Brush.
Prime vehicle:
prepare surface for new paint. Requires Spray Primer.
Paint Your Ride!
You have two options:
Paint with ready-to-use sprays - 25 predefined colors for you. Find HSV Spray Paint Catalogue to preview the available colors;
Mix any color you want.
In order to do that you need Automotive Paint White and any Tinting Paints (7 available, or you can paint with just clear white paint), and, of course, Spray Gun (requires battery to operate) to apply. Find HSV Tinting Paint Catalogue for tints proportions for some colors.
Every step (except washing) requires personal protective equipment. One of the following:
Dust Mask and Safety Goggles;
Gas Mask;
Nuclear Biochemical Mask.
Safety first!
Paint amounts
One paint can has 10 units of paint.
The larger the car, the more paint is required. Ranges from 21 (2.1 cans) to 45 units (4.5 cans) for the vanilla vehicles.
One tinting paint bottle has 100 units of paint.
To mix a color you can use up to 100 units of each tint. You can achieve same color with different tints combinations.
Items spawn
Spray and tinting paints are distributed mostly in boxes: open them to get up to 4 spray cans of one color or up to 8 tints (6 different + 2 black). There is a chance to get full cans/bottles.
