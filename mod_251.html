The kind of communities where all the houses look a little too similar, where the sprawl stretches for miles in all directions. This is a collection of tiles for Project Zomboid that add those kinds of style walls, roofs, doors, windows, and other details that you would typically see these kind of communities.

This is a work-in-progress with plans for future expansion including brick siding, new windows, and construction elements.
Anyone is free to modify the content of this pack as they need for their map.
