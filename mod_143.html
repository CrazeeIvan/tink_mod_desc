坐落于河畔东部跨河城市，总面积约为路易斯维尔的五分之三。
僵尸密度较高，主要集中于城区入口，难度较高，前期略高于路易斯维尔
物资主要集中于城区，郊区有一个军事基地，拥有较多的河边别墅，更适用于多人联机以及服务器的安全屋设置。
城区更类似于小型渡鸦港，高楼较多，总体物资量与路易斯维尔大致持平.
Located in the river crossing city in the east of the river, the total area is about three fifths of Louisville.
The density of zombies is high, mainly concentrated at the entrance of the urban area, which is more difficult, and it is slightly higher than Louisville in the early stage
The materials are mainly concentrated in the urban area. There is a military base in the suburbs, with more riverside villas, which is more suitable for multi person online and server safe house settings.
The urban area is more similar to the small Raven harbor, with many tall buildings, and the overall material volume is roughly the same as that of Louisville
