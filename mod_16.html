This mod is meant to address a single problem. You all know too well that awkward moment when the upper levels of your base get invaded by zombies. If you're lucky enough to survive this, you end up with piles of corpses all around the place. But then it's so annoying to get rid of all the corpses, right? Well, in that case you can just
throw them out the window!
;D
