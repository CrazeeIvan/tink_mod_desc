Since you were little, you always knew the end was near. You didn't know when or  how, but it didn't matter. You decided that you were going to survive.
After years of work and sacrifice, your life's work was finished: A huge doomsday bunker with everything you would ever need to survive the end of the world.
But you were too late. One day too late. Your generator, water purifier and all of the supplies needed to survive were supposed to arrive on July 10, but now, July 9, the roads are closed and the dead are rising and feasting on the living. So you have a perfectly safe doomsday bunker, but no supplies.
This is what you get for being a...
LAST MINUTE PREPPER
Welcome to this idea I had after playing with a lot of mods with overpowered bases. There's a lot of amazing bases and bunkers in the workshop, but I have a problem with all of those: Too much loot.
Let's be honest, the best part of this game is looting houses and shops. Why would anyone risk themselvs in endless loot runs if your giant base already had everything you needed to survive?
So, I made this: A big bunker (as big as it can be to be powered by only one generator) with tons of storage space but with almost no real loot, for those players who enjoy looting but not building a base.
There's two maps withing this mod. One of them is the old version of the mod (legacy) and it's only there to save old games from file corruption (or you could use it anyways if you think that the garage is too big).
Use just one of them at any time
(if you use both, one will overwrite the other and bad things could happen)
The bunker is divided in the following areas:
Garage: The entrance of the bunker. It has a lot of space for vehicles and a mechanical workshop.
Library: To store all your books and magazines.
Bar: A cozy place to store all of your alcohol and to have a good time with friends.
Armory: A lot of space for guns for those who enjoy playing with Brita's mods.
Hospital: To store all your medicine and to recover from close encounters with zeds.
Laboratory: Intended to be used with the zombie virus vaccine mod.
Food storage: A big storage area behind the kitchen with two freezers and a big refrigerator.
House: This is the only place where you will find loot in the bunker. Thanks to three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, an office, a living room and a dining room, the american dream has never been more alive (unlike the rest of humanity).
FAQ
- Where is the bunker?
South of Louisville, take a look at the pictures I uploaded to know the best route to take after passing the military checkpoint
- It doesn't work on multiplayer
You are installing it wrong. To enable a mod in multiplayer, you have to add it twice. First in the workshop section of the settings, and then on the mod section. Then, make sure the required mod, Daddy Dirkie Dirk's tiles, is enabled. This map has to be loaded
AFTER
the vanilla map (there's and entire section on the server settings dedicated to this).
- Can I add it to an existing save?
Like any other map mod, it is recommended start a new game to use it. You can still add it to an already existing save if you didn't visit the cell
- Does the bunker have (insert random feature that vanilla buildings don't have)?
No. There's no additional code involved in this mod. The bunker works like any other building on the map, but bunker shaped. Does it have infinite electricity? No, you need a generator. Does it have inifinite water? No, you need to plumb water collectors. Are the entrance doors indestructible? No, they are literally just garage doors.
For any other questions you might have, just ask yourself "does any vanilla buildings do this?" and that will be your answer.
