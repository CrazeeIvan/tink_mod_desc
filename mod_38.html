<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2725378876' target='_blank'>Mod 38</a></h2><p>Hey all, Real life has got me by the short ones. I'm unable to work on modding for a bit, I got new medication and my work is taking off, so I promise I will get back to it, but not for a bit.
They Knew
The Knox county incident was never a "random accident" or whatever the news was saying. Someone knew about this. They were there on the ground to observe the effects. What they didn't know, was how bad it was going to be.
Search the map for a new rare zombie! This zombie has a medicine for the zombie infection on them. I wanted a zombie virus cure that combined danger with reward. There are several zombie cures out there, this one is my version. The spawn rate is configurable in the Sandbox Variables.

Zomboxivir: The inhalant that can purge you of the zombie virus. Further infections are unaffected.
Zomboxycycline: These pills are used in a manner similar to Malaria prevention medication. These pills prevent infection for 24 hours. Don't forget to take your medicine! (This is disabled by default, you need to up the drop chance in the sandbox options if you want it to spawn)
SANDBOX OPTIONS
The default for this zombie is 500. This means the mob is VERY RARE. The rest of the zombies in the default category have values between 20000 and 2000. The golfer zombie for instance (quite rare), has a score of 2000. Park rangers have a score of 10000.
FAQ:
Can this mod be installed on an existing game/server?
Yep! Should just work. You will need to go to new areas to start seeing the zeds, or wait for respawns.
Is this multiplayer ready?
Yep!
There are too many of this zombie!
On single player: Install
THIS
mod. Change the spawn rate.
On multi player: See below.
How do I configure the sandbox settings for a dedicated server?
Load your dedicated server settings in the "host" option (click HOST instead of JOIN, or SOLO). Then, configure the sandbox settings there. Once you are done (lowest setting would be 1 instead of 50) save the settings, and exit host. Restart your server, and it should use the new sandbox settings. (TIP: This can be done even after the server has been going for a while, just close the server, load the file, edit and save. Next time you restart server, the settings will have changed).
When should I use my dose?
The best way to know when to use it, is when your character starts showing signs of infection! (Nausea, Nervousness)
Do I need 1 dose for each bite?
No. One dose will cure all infection on you. Even if you get bit 20 times.
Why is the bite still there after I use the cure.
Bite injuries will have to heal normally. The infection is the only thing removed.
NEXT RELEASE
Zomboxycycline - Once a day pill to prevent infection. Will NOT cure an infection. Only used as a preventative.
