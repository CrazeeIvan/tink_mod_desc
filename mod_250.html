<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784607980' target='_blank'>Mod 250</a></h2><p>This flag pack adds 500 new flags that can be hung up on the walls around your house or base. Each flag comes in two sizes, large (three tiles wide) and small (one tile wide, hanging vertically). The flags have all been painstakingly designed to look like the game's original flags.
Multiplayer server admins can spawn the flags using the names provided in the screenshots. As a point of note, all flags in this pack begin with the prefix "ENF" (ExtraNoise's Flags) followed by the flag name. Small flags include the suffix "Small". These are great for adding character to servers whose players might want to establish boundaries for their faction or other player representation.
Included Flags
Included in this pack are: National flags (unfortunately not all nations are included, but it is a vast majority), European regional flags, Canadian provincial flags, US state flags, historical flags, independence movement flags, fictional flags from media, US national and international organization flags, various protest flags, pride flags, a collection random flags and banners, some handwritten "flags" using bedsheets for flavor and base labeling, and a selection of flags that are my favorites from reddit's r/vexillology subreddit.
Now Craftable!
I appreciate everyone's patience as I worked diligently to make each of the flags in the pack craftable--at almost 50,000 lines of code!--so that players can now make them in the game without having to rely on multiplayer server admins to spawn them in (helpful if you are not playing a multiplayer server, as you can imagine). In order to make them, you will need to first craft a blank flag using
sheets, scissors, a needle or sewing kit, and thread
. Once a blank flag has been crafted, you will need
a paintbrush and paint buckets
to paint the flag. It's not an elegant solution, but it is designed to keep your context menus simple instead of trying to list out 500 options when you accidentally right-click a sheet in your inventory.
A warning:
Paint cans are heavy! I've updated the recipes so that flags can be crafted from paint cans on floors or shelves. You can also have the paint cans on you, but being overloaded can cause injury.
Good luck and don't say I didn't warn you.
Regular Players
You need to subscribe to this mod if you've downloaded a map that makes use of the tiles in this pack or a multiplayer server has been configured to use them. You don't have to enable the crafting sub-mod included unless you want to use it or the multiplayer server you're on uses it.

A Note on Discretion
Flags are one of those things that are often considered benign and inoffensive... until they aren't. Included in this pack are a number of flags that have a sordid history. For example, even the United States flag could fall into this category for some people. That being said, where contentions arise I have chosen to use the current flag for any given nation/region instead of the 1993 version (which some flags use) based on the in-game start date. A good example of this is the inclusion of the 2021 Mississippi flag instead of its predecessor. This is purely up to my own choice and may be changed in future releases of this pack. I have chosen to omit a number of incredibly divisive or incendiary flags, such as those used by hate groups in the modern day. I will absolutely not entertain the idea of including these flags in future releases, so please do not ask.
Anyone is free to modify the content of this pack as they need for their map/server.
