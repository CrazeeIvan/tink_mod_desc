So you should aim zombie's head for high damage.

Therefore, it is possible to attack both lower and higher floors than the player.
Should change aim level manually to shoot lower or higher floor. (See 'Z-axis Shooting' section)
If you're using Gunfighter, use this or Z version.
Z Version
: Cannot shoot at the height player wants.

Tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
In default setting, damage isn't that strong for some people. So if you don't like this,
I recommend changing sandbox options
. (Check 'Adjust Base Damage' & 'Base Damage Multiplier' options)
#
In default setting, when the aiming level is low, the aiming speed is quite slow and the recoil is enormous, so it may be difficult to use firearms. Modifying the sandbox options is fine, but I give a little weight to attachments' options for increasing the value of attachments.
So when the aiming level is low, I recommend actively using the attachments like muzzle brake or grips that reduce recoil or scopes that reduce aiming time
.
