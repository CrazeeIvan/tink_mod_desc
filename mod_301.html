is a mod that allows you to customize the order of the items in your hotbar.
Simply drag and drop the hotbar slots to rearrange them to your liking.
This mod also adds the ability to click on the hotbar slots as an alternative to pressing the hotkeys.
FAQ
Clicking on some slots doesn't work!
Clicking on the hotbar slots relies on a keyboard hotkey being set. Ensure you have mapped hotkeys for the slots beyond the vanilla 1-5.
How do you get all those slots?
Other mods are required. I'm using the tier 3 ALICE backpack from
Authentic Z
in the second preview.
