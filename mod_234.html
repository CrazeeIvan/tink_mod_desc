- Watch a movie at the cinema after bowling a perfect 300 at the bowling alley;
- Claim one of the 100+ house and make it your own;
- Take over the farm and live the country lifestyle;
- Go camping and take advantage of the excellent facilities in the east;
- Brave the trailer park with the friendly neighbors;
- Attempt to make the large hospital, police station and fire station your own;
- Find and take over the military base;
- Learn some new skills in one of the two top rated schools;
- Or hunker down in one of the towns fine drinking establishments
So head over to Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over.
