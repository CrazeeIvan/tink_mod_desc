Not to mention the 37-inch trail tires and removable hardtop (and doors). The new Bronco was specifically designed to take what makes the Jeep Wrangler so good and do it better.
Did they succeed? I'll let you be the judge as you bypass those pesky streets full of zombs to take the scenic route (which, honestly, is probably also full of zombs) as you enjoy the top down with the wind and blood in your hair.
The version released here is the four-door 2021 Ford Bronco Wildtrak edition with Sasquatch package. Quite the mouthful, but what it boils down to is "the good version" with "the big ol' tires."
About
The hard top is assigned to the "rear windshield" and can be taken off by removing the rear windshield using the vehicle mechanics menu. It requires a wrench and just a single mechanics skill to replicate the fact that it's fairly easy to do in real life. The doors can be similarly removed.
This vehicle is not lore-friendly! The game takes place in 1993 and this vehicle is from 2021.
It is my tenth vehicle and was made as fun thank you to my Patreon patrons for supporting me through ten releases. I was originally planning to release it just to them, but they urged me to release it everyone and they eventually convinced me. This is the first in what will probably be a limited run of anachronistic vehicles I release every time I hit 10 vehicles.

Future Plans
The spare tire on the back is fixed in place whether it is "there" or not as it is part of the tailgate mesh. I was not able to find a good solution, as it either the spare tire appeared but clipped the opening tailgate or failed to appear at all. I will update this mod once I find a solution.
Ethos
My goal is to release cars that fit naturally into the game world and stylistically match the base-game's textures and art design. Additionally, I've also strive for my work to be ultra light-weight (to keep performance smooth) and to look great with other vehicle mods that share a similar ethos, such as Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars, fhqwhgads' Motorious Zone, and improvement mods such as the Vanilla Vehicle Enhancer, among others.
My vehicle mods use real world names.
