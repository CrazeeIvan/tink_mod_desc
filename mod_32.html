This mod allows you to build wells!
Wells have been around since the times of the roman empire. I figured an experienced survivor would be able to build a well for long term water storage.
How it works:
First you need to find and read the magazine "Before the Pipelines".
Once you have the knowledge, you need a hammer and a shovel.
If you have the tools in your inventory, a new option will appear in the world context menu (right-click on the ground).
Place your cursor in the "Build well" option and you will see the skills and materials you need.
You can only place wells in the dirt or grass, and away from the sewage system. This means you cannot place them on roads, trailer parks and towns/cities.
Have fun suiting your long term bases with these!
Note:
If you find an error in the translation, please let me know and I'll fix it ASAP.
