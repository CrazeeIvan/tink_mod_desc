<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337452747' target='_blank'>Mod 247</a></h2><p>A collection of tiles, this mod as a standalone will not have any effect on the game. This mod simply does the behinds the scenes magic to make all the tiles function as intended.
Now, if you are not making maps/mods and are simply using this mod as it is required for another mod all you need to do is subscribe to this mod.
If you want to support my mapping efforts please check out my Patreon, all the support is greatly appreciated!

HOWEVER, if you want to make maps and wanna use these tiles in your zomboid editor read below:
The tile files themselves can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/1OCKLNmHbpBMtf0eOvN5nDoyGRtt-VfME
to use these tile simply extract them to your tiles\2x\ tiles folder (mine is here G:\Steam\steamapps\common\Project Zomboid Modding Tools\Tiles\2x)
Mappers are free to use these tiles in their own maps. But be aware that users of that map will also need to be subscribed to this mod.
So in short:
Yes, you are able to use these tiles in any map aslong as you give credit.
No, you are not allowed to redistribute or edit these tiles without my written permission.
If there are questions or issues with the tiles please contact me on discord or comment down below
