<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3025055056' target='_blank'>Mod 232</a></h2><p>I like gated communities. So I made a mod that adds one to the north side of West Point, right by the river.
It includes 6 houses/mansions of variable sizes. Some looking richer than others.
A baitshop has also been added nearby.
IngameMap is done. Foraging Zones are done. Zombie Zones are done.
The Spawn Points include houses inside the Gated Comuunity as well as house located right beside the community's fences.
There's also a secret hidden somewhere. I haven't seen anyone speak up about it. Can you find it ?

Do you like this? Try my other maps :
West Point Trailer Park & VHS Store
: It adds a VHS store south of West Point since it's missing one.
Rosewood VHS and Gun Stores
: It adds a VHS Store and a Gun Store south of Rosewood since it's missing both of them.
"We want to use this map in a mod pack, do we have permission ?"
Yes, as long as it's a private mod pack.
"Can I add this midgame ?"
If you haven't visited that part of West Point in your saved game, yes.
