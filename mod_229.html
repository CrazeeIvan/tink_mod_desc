The days were passing slowly as you watched time ride by along the rails. When, suddenly... Bang! A car crashed just outside your window. You better go check if they're alright.
Ever noticed how unrealistically empty the roadsides of Project Zomboid where? In real life you would see lots of crap there, tombstones, power boxes, sheds, chapels, rest stops with picnic tables and all that, right? So I decided to make a small 1 cell map with just that.
This map adds a nice little isolated base location between Muldraugh and March Ridge, a two story railroad guardhouse with a small garden. It's inspired by all the rustic old junk I typically see driving through the countryside. There are also many small secrets hidden around the cell. I advice you to explore it thoroughly as it's worth it, trust me.
Compatibility notes:
- cell no. 39x37.
- compatible with Redstone Raceway, Ashenwood, Petroville, Terminus.
- incompatible with ZONA, Phoenix Beta 1.4 Final Flaw, St. Bernard's Hill.
