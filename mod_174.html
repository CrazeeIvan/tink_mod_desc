Made for 41.60+
Q: Does it...
A: Yes it works in MP, yes it works with the new map, yes it works on any MP server rented or otherwise. No I am not going to help you with rented servers or MP servers in general.
Q: Could you...
A: No.
This little town adds:
- 14 new houses + garages/sheds
- A farm
- Fossoil fuel station + Ice parlor
- Mojo's Motel
- Grace's Groceries
- Brandon's Bar
- A few hidden things
This map mod changes cell 27,28 and will be incompatible with any other mod that changes this cell. Anything else goes.
I created this mod to spice up the middle of the map and to go together with my other mod
Ed's Auto Salvage
but it works just fine on it's own. Probably a more balanced place to start your game then Ed's. :)
It was not specifically made to include a player base, but the farm or one of the larger houses can certainly be used as your base.
Big thank you to Trash Queen who made a
plugin for the Eris Minimap!
I made this for myself and I may or may not update this mod, I may or may not fix any issues, no promises.
Requests to add or change anything will be largely ignored.
Permissions:
Anyone may include it or make it compatible with any other mod or modpack, go nuts!
