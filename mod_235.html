Simply put, this map connects Dirkerdam or Coryerdon to Over the River. There's also a spawn point, and the map can sustain itself somewhat via foraging, fishing, rummaging through the various buildings, etc.
Features!
40 custom buildings, with some being based on real locations from my childhood.
In game map support, with POIs such as a grocery store, gas station, book store, etc.
Forest trails (hidden on map) w/shelter houses, fishing holes, wells, and stuff!
One spawn point, but in a tight spot resource-wise for a little challenge.
Vehicle spawns, working foraging, some great spots for secluded bases, and more.
Please realize...
My main connecting road goes to the very edge of its cells without obstructions, besides zombies of course. There isn't anything I can do about how the other map authors treat their roads. So for now, you'll want to move/destroy those road blocks on the edge of Coryerdon, and clear out some trees and maybe even lay concrete down on the edge of Over the River. If you choose Dirkerdam instead of Coryerdon, it's a clean seamless connection.
I chose not to overwrite the adjoining cell of Over the River or Coryerdon as this would require a specific map load order to line everything up, and that would surely cause confusion, not to mention I didn't feel comfortable with overlaying my work onto someone else's.
Huge ass thanks to Daddy Dirkie Dirk
