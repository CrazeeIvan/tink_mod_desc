makes the visible corpses from
Visible Generators and Corpses
stay visible while you
Just Throw Them Out The Window
and can't function without those mods. they're required!
gratitude
credit to co' and planetalgol for their excellent mods (and co' again for their neat poster!!)
descr
(1) changes the animation to the Throw Corpse Out The Window timed action! normally the visible corpse disappears as a character does the "looting" animation which ive always found a bit jarring. (2) also changes the animation for holding a corpse slightly so that both arms are up when carrying. enjoy!
for ppl who need this info: when correctly loaded after the required mods: redefines
ISThrowCorpse
from OutTheWindow; overwrites shared/
VisibleGeneratorsAndCorpses_vanillaModifications.lua
from Visible Generators and Corpses; overwrites script code in module Base for
item CorpseMale
and
item CorpseFemale
got
Skizot's
Carryable
Everything
?
use my other mod instead—
Corpsesstay
Carried
while Throwing Out The Window
! (don't use them at the same time, ya donk!)
(using
Out With It
? try
Out With Invisible Corpses and More...?
)
