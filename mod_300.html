<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2900671939' target='_blank'>Mod 300</a></h2><p>This mod addresses the need of vanilla friendly realistic primitive metalworking. It has tons of recipes but it wont let you craft EVERY metal object there is in the game. It is meant to be a profession suitable for a self learned apocalypse survivor or a former blacksmith - not for a superhero who can magically craft complex machinery after reading a magazine.
Works in SP and MP and can be added to existing savegames.
New items:
Stone furnace, bellows, anvil, forging mold, charcoal pit, metal cutter, hand drill and grindstone. + Two recipe books.
Recipe details:
Most metal items can be melted using a furnace or a blowtorch.
The other half can be stomped with any hammer-like object.
You can also mine various ores with my :
Dynamic Mining
mod.
Both - melting and stomping- will create unusable metal that is melted into iron ingots.
Most car parts and metal furniture can be melted into unusable metal as well (Furnace or blowtorch).
All gold/silver can be melted into nuggets and uses along with metal to create welding rods.
From iron ingots you can forge tons of tools, materials and even engine parts, using - molds, metal cutters, hand drills, knives, hammers, grindstones etc.
Mold is drainable and needs to be refilled with dirt time to time.
Charcoal is made in a charcoal pit by slow burning wood for couple of days.
All recipes can be created from ground so you can have materials/items nearby and not in your hand. Just in case be sure you keep your other stuff you don't want to be melted further away from the metal works area.
Furnace and charcoal pit is built on the spot and cant be moved without destroying it first. Anvil and Grindstone can be moved but are heavy. Destroying a furnace will give you most of the stuff back.
Metal antique oven and BBQ can also be craft-forged.
Blowtorch uses both petrol and propane.
Dismantle railroad tracks, big metal structures and various industrial equipment into metal.
Small chance to get hurt(scratched) when doing metalwork.
Everything related to metalworking needs a certain skill + a recipe book. Metalworker profession starts with some free recipes already given to them.
This is part of... :
Project Realistic Overhaul
- Set of mods I've created that will overhaul the vanilla game experience to be more hardcore and true to life, but on the other hand leaves you the option to make it through and survive. It makes items and actions have more value and makes the world more alive.
