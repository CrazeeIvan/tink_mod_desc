Notice!
Use only one version of the mod. Latest mod id is "ISA_41". If you have installed mods with same mod_id then you won't be able to select which one is loaded.
Mods that delete changes made to default actions like inventory transfer and generator interactions can cause problems.
Enable x2 Textures in options or tiles will appear wrong in world, if you have other tile problems try to identify which map or tile mod is incompatible. Disable any other mods and see if the issue persists.

I found a bug that's not covered above, what to do now?
First of all, you should try to reproduce the bug with only this mod enabled and write the steps necessary to reproduce the bug. If you can't reproduce it with only this mod then try to limit it to a specif set of mods. Check your logs for errors and post them with any other relevant information.
