Notes for players
Cell location: 42:15, 43:14, 43:15, 44:14 and 44:15
It respawns loot.
With default Zombie population there are around ~2.000 Zombies inside the building only.
The airplanes have a full interior and can be entered. They are not 100% free of some issues (clipping/moving) due to the nature of the engine limitations.
They are now considered buildings and have a light switch.
I have also added another type of airplane, which sits somehwere on the run strip - a C-47 like plane and an additional normal one.
But, can they fly? Well, it is the apocalypse, we are grounded. Sorry.
I do not take responsiblity for any broken bones, falling off the wings or doors.
If you do encounter any breaking issues, blocked areas etc., please report it here in the mod.
