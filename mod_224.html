Please Read-
Lore friendly
Cell 12,18. No known conflicts. But I will add any to the description if they are found.
Situated west of Riverside.
Includes an in-game map.
Includes foraging.
Includes a spawn point.
Works in multiplayer.
I've listed 'Azakaela's Tile 2 Item Convertor' as a optional mod as it does spawn in a little story scene about what happened to the yacht's crew, but this mod is optional to those who don't want the scene.
*Entered into the July Map Jam Contest for the theme - Tourist Trap*
Thank you to all the tile makers, the mapping discord peoples and especially Wolfie who created and allowed me to tweak the ship!
