<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2758443202' target='_blank'>Mod 31</a></h2><p>Adds an Oldschool Runescape styled experience bar, including experience drops whenever you earn experience to give you those sweet, supple dopamine hits as you grind your carpentry skill up.
-------------------------------
The bar can be moved anywhere on screen, and has an option to be hidden if wanted.
You can choose freely which skills should show experience drops. (Right-click and choose "Configurate")
By default it will track every skill except Strength, Fitness, Lightfooted, Sneaking and Maintenance, since these skills can be a bit "spammy" with experience gains. But you are free to change this if desired.
Shows Runescape icons for most skills, although certain icons had to be improvised. Weapon skills show PZ icons.
Technically works with any modded skill, but the skill might not have an icon.
-------------------------------
Updated on 2023-10-11:
Text should now display correctly when using different font sizes.
Skill names should no longer overlap when using a language with very long skill names (such as French or Spanish).
Text/Checkboxes on the "Configurate" window should no longer run off the window/screen.
-------------------------------
This mod is named "OSRS Experience Bar" in the in-game mod list.
Feel free to use the mod on any server or in any package/collection you want, I don't mind, it's all good.
