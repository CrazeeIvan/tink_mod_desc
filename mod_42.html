What does this do?
This mods adds
29
new, realistic and lore-friendly Federal, State, County, Town and private agency uniforms and vehicle liveries to the game. No simple replacements, they're all their own items. Each agency based on what they looked like in 1993's Kentucky, to the best of our abilities. And much more to come...
Outfits spawn on both zombies and in the map. NightScale has gone and mapped each area so that the Rosewood uniforms spawn in Rosewood, West Point police in West Point, Louisville in the city, the DOC sets spawn in the various jails and the prison and the same for the rest. No more generic uniforms for the whole map.
Check the pinned discussions for more information.
What is "Safe Mode" (STRS)?
Safe mode greatly lessens the risk of mod conflicts or major issues. It's enabled by disabling the "custom zombie zones" sandbox option. Though expect situations that aren't so lore-friendly, i.e. Rosewood Police in Louisville.
What is STO?
SmallTownOverrides is a sandbox option that dynamically replaces specific zombies and vehicles so that the content is no longer limited to police stations.
