Uncle Red’s Bunker Redux
Crazy Uncle Red was an… Interesting dude. Served in "’Nam", conspiracy nut and all around crazy old guy, made some killer moonshine though.
He built this Bunker to live out whatever doomsday situation he dreamed up. He just finished it when the Feds got on his tail for bootlegging.
He ran down to mexico before he had a chance to stock up on supplies. He used to let you hunt out near his shine shack. Now that the dead are walking maybe uncle red wasn’t so crazy.

It’s a Bunker, man! (with roof access, also good for planting crops ? )

F.A.Q
Q: How do I unlock the armory doors?
A: it’s honestly luck of the draw whether they are unlocked or not, or if a key spawns in the kitchen
if anyone has info on how to guarantee a key spawn let me know.
Q: Will it work in multiplayer?
A: It worked fine in my testing, but I’m far from an expert when it comes to multiplayer or server stuff.
Q: mod conflicts with [Blank]
A: Sorry to hear that, through a lot of trial and error this was found to be the best spot (thanks to Postal)
and there are currently no plans to move it.
Q: Can I add this to an existing save?
A: Sure can, Use
