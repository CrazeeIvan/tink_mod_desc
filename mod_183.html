Welcome to Monmouth County, located East of Dixie crossroads..
Monmouth County is inspired by the locations of the View Askewniverse (Kevin Smiths movie based universe) but also includes numerous other things to explore and enjoy.
Need a packet of cigarettes? Head on over to the Quickstop, we assure you they're open. Need to chow down on a burger from Moobys? You can do that too, just remember to avoid the tall drink of water who is the pillar of the shopping community as he may have a nefarious plan to bite you in an extremely uncomfortable place!
