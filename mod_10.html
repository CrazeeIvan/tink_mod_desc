This mod adds more crafting features to the game!
With this mod you no longer have to drop your broken tools on the ground.
Now you can disassemble them for scrap (screws, metal parts, wood)
You can also disassemble any metallic vanilla item in the game to get small amounts of metal scrap.
This mod also works with other popular mods like Bushcraft Tools!
To disassemble something you need a Metal Workbench which needs to be learned by a recipe book and some metalworking skill. You can scrap items in the "Scrapping" crafting tab.
This mod also adds a few more crafting items and tools which are needed for the scrap series mods.
All items have 3D models and textures.
UPDATE:
Fixed all loophole exploits.
COMING SOON:
More crafting components
More mod compatibility
KNOWN ISSUES:
None
Thanks to Chuck for the cool preview image!
