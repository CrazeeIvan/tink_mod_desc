HERE IS THE OFFICIAL GUNFIGHTER MOD [2.0] GUIDE
- Do NOT run Old or Multiple Versions of GunFighter Mod
- You MUST Update Brita's Weapon Pack, GunFighter[2.0] Requires Most Recent Version
- Single-Player Still Requires ModOptions
- Multi-Player uses Sandbox Settings, NOT ModOptions
- Do NOT run ANY
SERVER_SETTING
mods. They are all
OBSOLETE
When Updating it's a good idea to unsubscribe mod(s) Make sure they are GONE... Re-Start steam... re-sub to the mod... After enabling them either on a Server or Local Machine in either SP or MP, Restart the game to allow assets to load, because they load on game boot, and not when you just enable a mod.
