-The

It also adds the possibility of
sharpening stones
(using 2 stones and 4 units of water) and making a
wooden mallet
(using 2 planks, 4 nails, hammer and a knife or chisel).
The mod tries to be faithful to the original content so they are not very strong or durable weapons, although they can become so if the character has decent skill levels.
If you find any bugs don't hesitate to let me know. If you have suggestions about balance changes are also welcome.
