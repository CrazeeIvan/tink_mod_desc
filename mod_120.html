To server owners, feel free to add our mods to your modpacks. We grant permission to all.
All headgear can be crafted by using the in-game crafting menu under the tailoring section. Some headgear requires a lot of ingredients and some require less. There is an admin only version available if you wish to have the masks in your server but only want them manually spawned in. Any mask suggestions or bug reports please put them in the right discussion.
DO NOT use both at once.
