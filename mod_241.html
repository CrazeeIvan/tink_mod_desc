I've had months of people requesting a road to Bedford Falls via Monmouth County but until my latest expanstion of Monmouth County it has not been a possibility. So with Monmouth County 4.0 having just been released/updated I have been able to create this stand alone road linking map.
Now if you run Bedford Falls and want a road connecting to the North of Bedford Falls via Monmouth you need just add this map and there will be a connecting road that is "under construction" but is more than drivable. I hope this solves any issues with using Monmouth County and Bedford Falls. Thank you for your patience with this and I hope you enjoy.
