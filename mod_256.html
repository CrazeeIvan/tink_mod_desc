Always check the update log for recent new tiles I add to the pack!
This is a custom tilepack I made for my own maps and for other mappers.
As a player you will need this mod only for Maps that require this tilepack.
(Screenshots may contain vanilla and other custom tiles wich are not part of this pack, feel free to ask for info)
You can find the png tile sheets here:
Google Drive Tilesheets
[drive.google.com]
Feel free to use the tiles and share with others.
Please do not modify or re-upload without permission.
Don't forget to give credit and proper respect.
