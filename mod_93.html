Details
Left panel:
mods that you have.
Mods from the Workshop are prioritized
: if you have mods with the same ID in your Steam mods folder and in
Zomboid/Workshop
or
Zomboid/mods
, Mod Manager: Server will display the mod from your Steam mods folder. Other functionality is the same as in Mod Manager.
Middle panel:
Workshop IDs in your server config. Hover your mouse over to see a tooltip with its name in the Workshop and currently added mod IDs.
Right panel:
mod IDs in your server config. Hover your mouse over to see a tooltip with its name and Workshop ID.
Changes can be saved using the
Save
button (cannot be undone). Selecting a different server config or going
Back
cancels all changes (unless you saved them earlier).
You can add mods you are not subscribed to by typing their Workshop ID and mod ID in the text input fields below the server mod lists.
If your server config contains mods that you are not subscribed to, they will be colored red. This doesn't mean they are broken, just makes it easier to manage the list.
Presets
Presets are saved in the same format as the server config ini files. So you can just copy two lines from the presets file and paste them in your config.
Note
: when loading a preset Mod Manager: Server will NOT warn you about broken or missing mods.
Saved presets location:
c:\Users\<user>\Zomboid\Lua\saved_modlists_server.txt
Maps and Spawn Regions
IMPORTANT:
This mod doesn't change
maps used by the server
and
spawn regions
! If you add or remove mods containing maps and/or spawn regions, you have to edit the
Map
and/or
Spawn Regions
sections of your server config manually in the vanilla
Manage Server Settings
window (or directly the ini config if you know what you're doing).
Compatibility

FAQ
You
do NOT need to add this mod (and Mod Manager too) to your server's mod list
. It only works in the main menu and does nothing when you play.
If you get an error when clicking the
Server
button in
Mod Manager
, make sure you have the latest version of it (currently
2.1.1
, you can check it in Mod Manager itself). If not, then unsubscribe from Mod Manager, wait before Steam finishes downloading (it says so even when uninstalling) and subscribe again, restart the game.
