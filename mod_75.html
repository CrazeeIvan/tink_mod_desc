Chevalier Rhino tow truck
to the game!
This is a replacement for the broken mod:
Harry's Functional Tow Truck - Chevalier Rhino
My changes to the mod itself:
- Removed dependency of the broken Better Towing Mod
- Removed any functionality connected to the Better Towing Mod
- Fixed the colors of the lightbar
- Changed some of the stats to make the suspension a little bit stronger
- The mod contains now only the vehicle
Please notice that I needed to remove the dependecy to the original mod as well.
My other mod fitting to this:
Mod description from harrycheez:
ATTENTION!
Unfortunately due to multiple problems in my life right now I will not be able to mod for a while. I cannot provide an estimate as to when I will be back to modding but I will say i was still working on creating new mods that have been put on hold. I'll be finishing those before updating these mods when I return to modding. Until I return anyone may post their own updates to fix broken features and maintain my mods should they desire, but please do not add anything extra.
Thank you for all of the support and encouragement I've received since I started doing this.

This mod started its creation before the anouncment that trailers would be added in vanilla, It was held off until the release of that update, and is now finally here!
Its designed to work alongside Aiterons amazing Better Towing mod.
It adds a new vehicle: the Chevalier Rhino which works as a tow truck, no need to find a tow bar or anything!
It also can more easily move the wrecked/ burnt vehicles.
Tow hitch working with the new trailers in B41.46.
