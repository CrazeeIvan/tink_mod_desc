Elliot Pond In the summer, the sandy shores of Elliot Pond are a lovely place to sunbathe. In autumn, the famous fall colours are on full display. In the spring, hike, bike, or ride the trails around Elliot Pond to enjoy the flora, fauna and beautiful lookout points. Elliot Pond is a community that combines the hospitality of a small town with the services of a larger, urban centre. The pristine wilderness and thousands of lakes that surround the area provide residents and visitors with many opportunities for hiking, camping and fishing.
You will find everything that you could ever need/want during a zombie outbreak in this map from nice and quiet  suburbs, a robust and varied shopping district, as well as decent industrial zones.
Over 300 Buildings all of which are custom built and decorated for you to explore, and survive in.
This map is compatible with the current versions of Eerie County, and Raven Creek. Anything else down in that area i'am not 100% sure about as i haven't tested every map out there. If there are compatibility issues please let me know and ill see what i can do.
P.S. Sorry about all the tile requirements i kinda got excited and went overboard. But hey isn't variety the spice of life?
