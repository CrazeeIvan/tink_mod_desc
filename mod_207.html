- Minimap! It should be working now, fully regenerated and updated (need to start new game)
- Updated core tileset - should resolve at least some of the red question marks issues
- Significantly decreased weapon spawns by removing military lockers in tents (was: 7-8 lockers, now 1-2 lockers)
- New building: "Beers" Bar & Restaurant
ABOUT:
This mod adds an expansion to northern part of Rosewood as well as a Zoo. Plot twist is that Zoo was closed early during the pandemic, and later was used as an evac center.
FEATURES:
- The expansion occupies 4 cells north of Rosewood, exact coordinates at map screenshot.
- Map implements 3 custom tilesets (which are required) so there will be plenty of new stuff to see.
- Map implements new minimap features.
- Properly zoned for foraging and zombie spawns.
- This map removes a gas station in north Rosewood - there is a replacements gas station almost at the same location, just a little bith to east.
I have removed the buildings list as it would be too long. I have both created my buildings as well as downloaded some from repository v2, huuuuge thanks to anyone who shared their builds there!
There are few prominent locations worth noting:
- American footbal field and premises
- Dirkea with tons of furniture
- Church with graveyard (because of course there is)
- Hobo town with scrapyard
- Supa secret bunker
- Mini mall
As well as countless shops, cafes, residential houses and more...
Compatible with:
- Pitstop
- Blackwood
- Grapeseed
- Lake Ivy Township
...and all others further away
Not compatible with:
- Eggplant Safehouse
Huge thanks to Cor for making a video!
