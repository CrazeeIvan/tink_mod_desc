In vanilla Zomboid the battery indicator is green if there is any charge at all, from 0.001 % to 100%.  This can easily result in a dead battery if you don't realize it is  running low after parking with headlights on, staying in one place too long without running the engine when using RV Interiors, or just stopping and starting the engine too much as you move from house to house

Works nicely with Colored Engine Status:

With this mod:
Green
: 75%+, everything is fine.
Yellow
: 50%+, everything is fine but run the engine for a bit to top it up
Orange
: 25%+, it will still get the engine going but charging is a good idea
Red
: 0%+, the engine might start but you really want more charge before you turn off the ignition in case it will not turn back on.
Dark Red
: 0%, completely dead.
Can this be added to an existing save?
Yes, this can be safely added and removed from existing saves.
Does this work in Multiplayer?
Untested, but it should because this is just a modification to one client LUA function
Can I include this in a modpack?
Yes.
Are there known incompatibilities?
This mod hooks in to ISVehicleDashboard:prerender() and adds additional code after the function executes which means it should not cause issues with any other mods, as all original  code is executed.
This mod will not work if Better Speedometers is installed, because that mod completely replaces ISVehicleDashboard:prerender() instead of hooking additional functionality in as a  patch.
