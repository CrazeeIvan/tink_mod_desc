(Click Link Above for info on the Update)
SELECT-ABLE TEXTURE SUBMODS HAVE BEEN REMOVED... HIGH SET IS CONSOLIDATED BACK INTO THE MAIN MOD(s).
The Idea was to provide some relief to slower PCs with the option to choose a much smaller set of textures (less then 10%) of the high rez... but this appears to have been a bad idea as enabling an extra mod and restarting the game was not being done consistently. So there is no LOW texture option anymore. We just had a discussion and came to this decision.
Be advised... Absolutely
