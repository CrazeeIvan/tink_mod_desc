Here is how you can do it manually
, if you really want to.

Known Issues
There were some compatibility problems with
huge modpacks
like "all symbols disappeared" and "resized to standard size". I haven't managed to reproduce them, sadly. So if you manage to reproduce this issue, please report it in the comments so I can fix it (if the issue is in my mod). That would be highly appreciated!
