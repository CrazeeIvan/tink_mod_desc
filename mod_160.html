Established in 1818, Greenport relied heavily on the fishing industry that the Ohio River provided for many years.  The local Cannery, was opened shortly after in 1821 by the town's first Mayor, Harrison Harrington.
Over the decades, the town continued to grow and become more self sufficient, attracting in many different professionals and businesses.
By the late 1980's the interest of most residents of Greenport had moved on from fishing due to the growing prosperity of the town, resulting in the Cannery scaling back production.  Seeing the changes in the town, the Mayor believed promoting the town's growing local business scene would help draw in the tourists and bolster the coffers of Greenport.  His plans included renovating parts of the large Cannery into a Tourism center, granting local artisans vending liceses to operate out of the historic town square and the construction of a community swimming pool and open air gym adjacent to the square.
Amenities in Greenport include: multiple fishing piers, gas station and mechanic shop, doctor's office, hunting and camping store, K-12 school, daycare, church and cemetary, bank, post office, book store, coffee shop, sewing store, barber shop, grocery and tool store, police station, bar as well as a beach and Fish n' Chip restaurant.
