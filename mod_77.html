Nightscale's Standardized Vehicle Upgrades!
Originating from the videogame BeamNG.Drive, the Gavril name brand in the United States is an icon of the nation's booming car industry, and the Grand Marshal was no different of a masterpiece. Released at the turn of the new decade, the Grand Marshal quickly made up the majority of full-size sedan sales across the country, surpassing what Chevalier or Dash could ever do for this prestigious, yet surprisingly affordable landboat.
Retailed Models:
V8 Standard:
The regular trim of their entire range, which even then was still a grand purchase. You got a fat V8 at the front, power in the back, a body larger than the Nyala in the middle, and much more spread across everywhere else. It was this specific model that did make up the large majority of all their sales to the public, so you can expect to find this automobile pretty much anywhere you could think a car would be.
V8 Luxe:
The Luxe model was namely designed specifically for Gavril's rapidly aging market base. With their most loyal customers having been born during or after the second World War to see the company build their way up to the present day, the Luxe model was modelled after the vehicles of the time to create a more familiar shape to them. Chrome-lined bumpers, whitewall tyres, and a deliberately more bouncy ride mimicked that of automobiles of the mid-century, but it still had modern technologies dotted everywhere else that wasn't visible for the seniors to see.
V8 Sport:
This was basically just the top-of-the-line for the general public to get. For this model, the company instead honed in on their veritable NASCAR history, putting a specialized team to recreate the Marshal to mimick those on the tracks. The result was this monster; which had an even larger V8 engine, stiffened suspension, thicker tyres and visual decorations that faintly call home to their racing life. It was quite excessive in its performance, but if there was one thing the American public loved aside from freedom, it was to be excessive.
Fleet Models:
Federal Use:
Police Package:
For Gavril's debut of the Grand Marshal, there was a big focus by the company to manufacture a portion towards the nation's police force. For the regular police package, it mainly came with everything the Nyala counterpart had, but with some notable extras. A sturdy bullbar out on the front, grill-mounted emergency lights, and a properly heavy-duty suspension system allowed this model to surge ahead basically just on sheer durability. As such, many rural county police departments had started introducing this vehicle to their fleets, namely citing their ruggedness to keep up with suspects both on and off-road if absolutely needed.
Undercover Package:
The undercover package was quite literally just the police package from before, but this time with an emphasis on laying inconspicuous. Though the illusion was blatantly broken with the bullbar still out front, the emergency lights were instead concealed off to the rear windshield and grill that at least made it not noticable as a law enforcement vehicle from far away. This particular fleet vehicle was rather popular either with many detective agencies across the nation, or federal agents who had noticed something going on down in the Knox County.
Interceptor Package:
This police model to put it bluntly was completely off the walls unheard of, and was a risk Gavril was actively making to see how it would turn out. With a deliberately lowered suspension and a ridiculously beefy engine throwing the car at the speeds of a Cossette, this thing was basically the V8 Sport model on steroids in its design. Despite this though, many interstate enforcements and state troopers had utterly adored this particular model, and the state of Kentucky was no different in quickly inaugurating this car on the many interstates darting across the state for the specific use in car chases and rapid response. Despite this, the cruiser still proved to be Gavril's least sold variant of the Marshal, but it was a damn good Marshal.
Civilian Use:
Taxi Package:
For the year of 1993, Gavril wanted to then try pushing their fleet sales to civilian companies instead, kicking it off with a taxi refit. With a slightly facelifted design compared to its 1990 editions, this model was designed specifically in order to replace Nyala's aging market share that was ripe for Gavril to take. The state of Kentucky in particular did take the oppurtunity to open a four year long contract with Gavril to phase out Chevalier from their transport fleets, but due to a small issue known as the 'Knox Event', only the inaugural models ever managed to get introduced into their lines.
