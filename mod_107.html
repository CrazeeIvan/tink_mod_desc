Goals of this mod:
Add the unused zombie outfits that the Indie Stone developers made
Add iconic George Romero-esque zombie outfits (Zombies hold items in their hands!)
Add appropriate setting and rarity for their clothing and items.
Here are some of the main features of Authentic Z.
Fat Zombies!
Zombies with missing arms and hands!
Backpack attachments. Upgrade your bags through 3 tiers to add more attachment slots!
Adds a new custom costume shop in Louisville. You will find lots of fun clothing and accessories in there.
The Crossroads Mall spawn zombies with random outfits = Random FUN!
The March Ridge Dormitory is rezoned to have unique zombie placement within it.
Ice Cream workers at each Ice Cream shop. Same thing with the new Donut Shops.
Dedicated spawns for Hazmat zombies, Service Uniform zombies, and Ghillie Suit zombies at the Secret Base
The large campgrounds, southwest from Riverside, are rezoned into Friday the 13th's Camp Crystal Lake. Find Jason, before he finds you! Includes other slashers like Michael Myers, Freddy Kreuger, and Leather Face!
Student and Varsity zombies at schools have been fixed to only have realistic hairstyles.
Fisherman and Poncho zombies alongside lakes and rivers (If zombies spawn there)
Hunter Zombies chance at isolated cabins and hunting stands.
Zombified Heroes from all your favorite zombie media
Famous Zombies from the zombie genre
Clown zombies…...Yes…...Clown Zombies

AuthenticZBackpacks+ ONLY has the backpack upgrading system.
Common Issues and their fixes
1. "My server won't start" "Normal Termination" etc etc
FIX - Update your copy of AuthenticZ, sometimes Steam doesn't do it correctly. Review Method 2 on updating mods for servers/local servers

2.  "I can't upgrade my backpack or use the attachment slots" etc etc
FIX - Make sure you are NOT running multiple branches of AuthenticZ, this is a common issue of doing that. Make sure you have the sufficient materials to upgrade. Secondary bags (small bags that you can not wear on your back) need a carabiner (can be crafted with 5 paperclips) so it can be attached to the "Secondary Bag Slot".

I do not give you permission to use the AuthenticZ assets for anything outside of gameplay functionality, unless specially given by me. My assets are considered Steam workshop items and can not be used to create NFTs. NFTs violate Steam TOS. Please do not re-upload my mod without my specific permission. I have the means and motivation to go after such violators.
