I'VE GOT NO TIME BETWEEN A DEGREE AND A JOB FOR FIGURING IT OUT! THATS WHY I UPDATE LIKE EVERY OTHER MONTHPlease consider helping me out, or commissioning some basement dweller, or figuring it out on your own, or something.Future PlansIf you really want another feature to this doinky 30-minute mod I made, then don't solely rely on me to do it and contribute something. Every little bit helps.People want a search bar, because apparently one isn't enough. I'd never use it, but why not do it anyway? BUT, long story short, things go KABLAM and BOOM and I need someone experienced with this game's UI to help me figure out how to "dim" the list elements darker, with opacity or something. I'll probably look into it myself once I get back to modding during a long vacation, but your help might make this thing happen faster!CompatibilityCompatible with every modOnly functions in main menu (multiplayer & save-game irrelevant)LanguagesIf you would like to have your language included, please create your own translations andprovide them to me below.

While it may have been an improvement at one point, and I thank him for trying to keep this mod alive, his version is apparently causing many issues in the new build. This version seems to still work very well.I have not been modding for PZ in quite a long time, however knowing this mod still works now as it did before makes me feel glad to have been part of the modding community. Should this start acting up for real, I may pass it on to someone more active, but as of now, I hope you continue to enjoy it. Thank you again Brybry and Blindcoder for helping to make improved mod compatability possible all these years---ORIGINAL POST---This modding API allows any modders to make multiple changes to any items loaded into the game's current database, while leaving the rest of the remaining values alone.Change any item's weight, display name, display category, hunger reduction, or anything else, while keeping the item as mod friendly as possible.(WARNING: changing TYPE will delete all instances of already spawned items)You can change only an item icon, while another mod changes the same item's weight, all without conflict (Unless mods do not use this mod to do so, or two mods try to change the same value, in which case, the last loaded mod will win)For the Simplest Implementation through LUA:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Begin Fileif getActivatedMods():contains("ItemTweakerAPI") thenrequire("ItemTweaker_Core");else return endTweakItem("Base.Needle","Icon", "Worm");TweakItem("Base.Needle","Tooltip", "Wearable: Waist");TweakItem("Base.Needle","DisplayCategory", "Repair");-----------------------------------------------------------------------End FileFor each item and property you wish to change, create a new line, and place the related values in place.You can even add custom ModData to items.TweakItem("Base.Needle","BaseValue", "500");Organized Item Names is an example mod to hopefully show beginner modders how to make use of this APIMods I know of using this API:Custom CategoriesJPCategoriesPlus- By: ProxyerLittering- By: SvarogJaw Stab Proliferation- By: LoonyLadelWedge's Item Name Fixes- By: Wedge McCloud (Includes changes for some other mods)Custom Categories(Outdated: Use Wedge's Item Name Fixes instead)Organized Item Names(Outdated: Use Wedge's Item Name Fixes instead)Wedge's Hydrocraft Tweaks- By: Wedge McCloud (Requires Hydrocraft)Better Carts- By: yuriy206 (Requires Hydrocraft)</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2810800927' target='_blank'>ItemTweaker Extra Clothing Option Addon (ID: 2810800927)</a><p>ItemTweaker Addon, Extra Clothing OptionsThis addon add allows to easily add multiple extra clothing options, such as "Open Jacket" or "Down Hoodie" to modded items using the ItemTweakerAPI.Currently, the ItemTweakerAPI doesn't allow to add a parameter to a field without overriding any previous changes.Using this add-on, multiple mods can add/replace or remove extra clothing option without completely overriding them.The add-on will try to include extra clothing options added without using the add-on.UsagePlace your lua script inside the media/client folder of your mod.Usage of this framework is as follow :

-- Don't forget to include the addon
if getActivatedMods():contains("ItemTweakerAPIExtraClothingAddon") then 
	    require("ItemTweaker_ExtraClothingOptions");
else return end


-- The addon features three functions : 

-- AddOrReplaceClothingOption will replace any option with the same name with the new one

-- First parameter is the full name of the clothing item on which to add the new clothing option
-- Second parameter is the full name of the clothing item that will replace the previous one once this option is triggered ("ClothingItemExtra")
-- Third parameter is the name of the extra clothing option, you will need extra stepts to create custom ones ("ClothingItemExtraOption")ItemTweaker.AddOrReplaceClothingOption("Base.HoodieUP", "Base.HoodieDOWN", "DownHoodie")-- AddClothingOptionIfDoesntExists will add an new clothing option if there is no other option with the same name
-- it will do nothing otherwise

-- Usage is the same as AddOrReplaceItemTweaker.AddClothingOptionIfDoesntExists("Base.HoodieUP", "Base.HoodieDOWN", "DownHoodie")-- RemoveClothingOption will remove the clothing option with the given name

-- First parameter is the name of the item containing the extra clothing option
-- Second parameter is the name of the extra clothing option ("ClothingItemExtraOption")ItemTweaker.RemoveClothingOption("Base.HoodieUP", "DownHoodie")Changelog05/26/2022The add-on will now try to add as many options that are added using the original ItemTweaker Core API, this should reduce mod conflict and avoid the need to create patches.Fixed a bug that could cause an error due to conflict with other mods.Known issuesEdditing the fields ClothingItemExtra and ClothingItemExtraOption with the ItemTweaker API after making changes this will override them, I'm currently working on a solution.Future plansImprove compatibility with mods making edits made with DarkSlayerEX's ItemTweaker that are not using this addon.Requirements and creditsThis addon requires theoriginal ItemTweaker mod by DarkSlayerEX.All credits for the original ItemTweaker goes to him.Workshop ID: 2810800927Mod ID: ItemTweakerAPIExtraClothingAddon</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684285534' target='_blank'>Spongie's Clothing (ID: 2684285534)</a><p>Supports B41.78+.

Should work in multiplayer.Adds new ways that clothing items can be worn such as: opening and rolling jackets/shirts, tying sweaters & hoodies, and tucking in pants.This affects almost all vanilla jackets, sweaters, shirts, coveralls, and pants.Opening a jacket or shirt will reduce its insulation. Rolling up sleeves will expose your forearms. Tying a sweater around your waist will only protect your lower body. Tucking in pants is only cosmetic.Wearing jackets open and rolled at the same time will make skirts invisible, this is the only way I could get the clothing masks to work because of a bug in the gameIt's fine to use and edit my assets for your own mods as long as you can credit me.Supported TranslationsRU - NikityanFR - i_am_dost & DelranDE - TrogonePTBR - Selitto, ESORDPAES - Arko PiktuviryPL - TheMitu97TH - OverlordIT - BurjakAR - SilvestreAlso check out these other mods:Workshop ID: 2812326159Mod ID: SpnOpenCloth</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3124097289' target='_blank'>Spongie's Open Jackets Optimized (ID: 3124097289)</a><p>Sub-mod for performanceMy sub-mod is made to improve the performance of the main mod.

However, if you don't care for it properly it could have dire consequences.Sadly, the base game doesn't reflect your condition, and this mod fixes that.You'll be able to see 5 different physique levels: Emmanciated, Underweight, Default, Fat and Obese, which reflect your character condition dynamically.You'll also have more muscles based on your character strength and fitness level (while they are Default).Currently, it seems to be only working correctly on SP, but I will try to work towards making it MP compatible (all players that log into the server will have to install the Java files though, so be careful).Check out my other workVoiced Radios & TVs:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950750587&tscn=1697826142(I need help of people willing to voice act, check it out for more info)HOW TO INSTALLYou'll need to open 2 folders: Your project zomboid base game folder, and the workshop mod folder.Copy the entire zombie folder to the base game folder.You can also get the zombie folder here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cwZGyRSMJqPwv_7wXRu99jDh9l9ateox/view?usp=sharingorhttps://mega.nz/file/b3YgVQ4C#AitFlVG-_hyA2jrYg-pVrQaPrG5knHwSjasJujstbuEYou need to make sure the mod is enabled FROM THE MAIN MENU, otherwise the skinning data will not load correctly.If your player skinning data is broken, go to the main menu, make sure Dynamic Body Shape is enabled, and restart the game. It should work correctly after that.(this is because the player mesh models aren't loaded correctly by the game :P, if you write reloadModelsMatching("MaleBody") in the console, you'll realise what I mean)That's it. I'll leave an instructive video showing the process.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mwOQ53rkdwHOW TO UNINSTALLI made the java modification as unintrusive as possible, but if you want to uninstall the mod for some reason:Deactivate the mod from the game, then on steam library right click PZ, go to properties, Installed Files and verify integrity of game files.COMPATIBILITYThe mod is incompatible with any mod that changes the player model mesh (not textures, just 3D models) (the character rigging would most likely break).The mod is compatible with clothing mods. However, it is extremely likely that the clothing will clip for Fat and Obese models.To fix this, it would require an addon for specific clothing mods. It only requires a copy of the clothing Items, with and _Fat and _Obese at the end of the TypeName.I know that Small Town First Responders (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2623855083) added support, for instance.Works with:+ Simple Character Retexture , By Hea~ Rae's Body Mod (the fat and obese model's work, but the muscular seem to not work, will investigate further)Does not work with:- Ellies's Hands and Feet Mod(thx Merlin for checking it out.)Mod InfoWorkshop ID: 3066054201Mod ID: DYN_BODY_SHAPE</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2680473910' target='_blank'>The Workshop (ID: 2680473910)</a><p>Welcome!This mod adds more crafting features to the game!With this mod you no longer have to drop your broken tools on the ground.Now you can disassemble them for scrap (screws, metal parts, wood)You can also disassemble any metallic vanilla item in the game to get small amounts of metal scrap.This mod also works with other popular mods like Bushcraft Tools!To disassemble something you need a Metal Workbench which needs to be learned by a recipe book and some metalworking skill.

This way, players can have an easier time imagining their own builds by themselves.It also adds the description on mouse hover in the character's info screen, in game. This works with descriptions of traits from other mods too, like Banjo's item kits or Dynamic traits for example.This is based on a combination of my own knowledge, the game's non-exposed Java files (that I learned how to decompile),  the game's exposed Lua files,  your feedback, and the wiki of PZ.Most of what I added in the traits' descriptions are in parenthesis so you can distinguish what is vanilla description and what is not.If you notice a typo, or know of an effect that is not listed, or spot something that is wrong or poorly worded, please leave a comment to point it out to me. I don't think I got every single effect that could be listed, and I may have made a mistake somewhere, so I'm relying on you guys for that.CompatibilityWorks with build 41 and in multiplayer.Compatible with:Dynamic Traits,More Traits,Banjo's Item kits,More Simple Traits...alsoDriving Skill,Scavenger Skill...So it should be compatible with any mod that adds traits or skills.Note:I will not list any EXPLOIT or BUG that is clearly unintended as part of a trait or profession's effects. The issue with Weak Stomach has been noted, and I made a bug report to the devs. If they don't fix it, I will update the description to point out the unintended issue.For those who want to know, the issue with Weak Stomach isit makes food illness last shorter instead of longer. (not as short as Irong Gut though)TranslationsFrench: DoneGerman: DoneSpanish:Done, but needs confirmationRussian:incomplete(needs an update)Turkish:incomplete(needs an update)Portuguese-Brazil: DoneSimplified Chinese:incomplete(needs an update)Traditional Chinese: DoneKorean: DonePolish: DoneItalian: DoneUkrainian: DoneOther languages :non-existantAnyone is welcome to volunteer to translate to their language.Foraging stats:The mod details the foraging stats bonuses for each trait and profession.Stats are : Foraging radius bonus, Weather Effect reduction, and Darkness Effect reduction and also Specialisation bonuses for every foraging category.All foraging stats are added dynamically, which means any balance changes will be automatically updated, and other traits that get foraging stats in their descriptions (if they have foraging stats).Source file: media/lua/shared/Foraging/forageDefinitions.luaCharacter Info Screen Tooltip:The mod displays the detailed description of each trait in the character's info screen window on mouse hover.

You've memorized the Wood Time TV Jingle. You've stolen countless cars, survived endless nights and you've scavenged your little heart out and yet, that elusive windshield or home window eludes you. Not anymore! Introducing "Improvised Glass"Utilizing over 20 new recipes and a few new times, you can now take those destroyed glass shards you've found in the world (or smash some yourself) and utilize nothing more than your oven and a baking tray to create new glass panes.  Slather it up with some wood glue to repair existing windows, or frame it off a build a completely brand new window for your house.  Got a scalpel on hand? Perfect, now lets cut that pane down to size and give ourselves a brand new windshield or side window.Life is just a little bit better with Improvised Glass. It is not meant to be a replacement for scavenging but more of a supplement. Maybe you already found 5 windows but the 6th is just no where to be found. No problem, build one!  Running out of decent windshields in your world? Why not just craft one and put an end to your headaches.  Just find the magazines scattered throughout the world to learn all the recipes and specialties.TL;DR:Take broken glass shards, smelt them in an oven to get glass panes. Use glass panes to craft windows for your house and vehicles. Disassemble windows in a house for half the materials and in single-player you can even repair your home windows without replacing them.  Glass objects can be smashed to produce glass shards or pick them up off the ground.Magazine ListMagazineTeachesRequiresHandyman Corner's Kitchen KilnsGlass Smelting-Woodtime: Topless in the WindowHouse WindowsCarpentry 2Precision vehicle windows and craftingVehicle WindowsMechanics 2Recipe ListAn entire directory of the available recipes is listed in thepinned discussions threadItem IDsImprovisedGlass.GlassPane

READ! READ! ****THIS MOD REPLACES SOME STOCK FILES AND TEXTURES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STARTING A NEW GAME BEFORE USING THIS MOD. DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU MESS UP YOUR SAVE FILE.Over 400 skins based on real world vehicles with realistic paint colors! Included are new wheels as well as textures for the wrecked and crispified versions also!This mod got started when I got tired of looking at all the weirdly pastel colored cars that spawn in the game by default so I decided to try and make things a bit more realistic. This basic goal got out of hand probably due to a case of OCD and this mod is the result.This mod replaces all textures for all vehicles in the vanilla game except for the trailer which I might do for a future update. The aim of this mod is to enhance the look of the default vehicles and to add some much needed variety to the vanilla motor pool.There are now three different types of police cars; a standard police car, a sheriff's car, and a state trooper car. These skins are based on the mod "Proper Police Skins" by Söze with permission. You don't need both mods for this to work but you will have to pick one or the other as they do conflict with each other.This mod will likely have problems working alongside any mod that messes with the files for the vanilla cars. I have tested this mod with a few vehicle related mods and have encountered issues with two mods for sure: Eggon's Worthwhile Cars and the Crashed Cars mod. Eggon's Worthwhile Cars causes some vehicle's textures to not show up properly and the Crashed Cars Mod causes the textures for the wrecked cars to not show up properly. This issue persisted no matter what order I ran the mods in. If you are fine with these problems you can continue using those mods.Workshop ID: 2788428718Mod ID: VVehicleEnhancer</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2719592131' target='_blank'>Tread's Water Tank Trucks [41.65+] (ID: 2719592131)</a><p>Tread's Water Tank Trucks [41.65+]This mod adds working water trucks and water tank trailers (and their water tank parts) to the game.

It adds a new trailer to the game. Sub-mod requiresKI5 "'82 Oshkosh M911" modsince it depends on its assets. Future updates to KI5 mod may be incompatible with this mod.Water Filter:Some Water Tank vehicles are equipped with Water Filter part. It can only be found on those vehicles and while installed it makes the dispensed/pumped water clean (disregarding tainted status of water in the tank). Filter works properly only if it is in good condition. Once it requires service, vehicle will dispense/pump water "as it is" in the tank (either clean or tainted). IF filter is in really bad shape, vehicle will dispense tainted water, even if filled with clean one.Water filter can be repaired with proper materials and skills. It can also be uninstalled and vehicle dispenses water "as is" in the tank.Filter slowly degrades with each water unit dispensed/pumped from the vehicle. Clean water (in the tank) causes slow degradation, whereas tainted one speeds it up. Uninstalling filter temporarily can be a valid approach in some situations.I had to pick some arbitrary values for balance - all constructive balance advice is welcome!How to add your own custom water storage vehicles and parts?Please look into the discussion topic - Steam limits description length so I had to move it.Future:I am not a professional programmer, experienced modder nor hardcore Zomboid gamer.

Nonetheless I do not promise I will have time and skill to do it on any regular basis.If you wish to fuel my modding activities please consider supporting me:[ko-fi.com]Languages:English (EN)Polish (PL)Dutch (NL) - thanks to my co-worker Nik for checking my translationBrazilian Portuguese (PTBR) - translation by Papa_ChadGerman (DE) - translation by BlackySpanish (ES) - translation by ИعşŞRussian (RU) - translation by SmileFrench (FR) - translation by KagouleTraditional Chinese (CH) - translation by sweet-Credits:I wish to thank a few people (and groups):TIS - for making this great game and plenty of code I could chop into shape of my mod,Filibuster Rhymes - for creating wonderful mod and allowing me to reuse his assets (models, textures, scripts) as base for my vehicles,TMC (Tsar's Modding Company) - for allowing me to reuse their KBAC Trailer and its assets (models, textures, scripts) as base for my water trailer,KONIJIMA - for creating great Water and Fuel related mods that inspired me to create this mod and for allowing me to reuse a function from his code,PlanetAlgol - for creating fuel truck code for Filibuster Rhymes mod, code that I studied, when I tried to get grasp on how Zomboid fuelling functions work,All the mentioned above - one more thanks for writing the code I could study and base on while learning to write this mod,Pawel-Commandos - for making custom textures and icons I use in the mod (Textures are adjusted assets from Filibuster Rhymes and TMC),KI5 - for allowing me to make water version of his "M967 Fuel Tanker Semi-Trailer" from his "'82 Oshkosh M911" mod and providing me with textures for it,All translators.Known Issues:Vehicle Water tanks and World Objects (e.g. water barrel) can be used by multiple players at once in MP. It will result in wrong final content values since multiple functions overwrite it without acknowledging each other.Pumping water into barrels that are connected together (by mod: "Irrigation pipes for farming and water supply [B41+]") can result in "water multiplication". It occurs when barrels "water equalisation" (Irrigation mod) ticks during pumping process. I will try to rewrite pumping function in a way that prevents it.Pumping tainted water into the sink (connected to the barrel) results in clean water in barrel. Sink serves as kind of "water filter" in both ways. I personally think it is just a bug or omission of vanilla game, but don't want to strip players of this "filter feature" as some are used to it. I keep it this way to stay more compatible with vanilla game.Usage of my code in other mods:I do allow usage of my code in other Zomboid mods. If you decide to do so please credit me in description.I cannot promise regular updates and long-term support therefore I do allow fixing, upgrading, updating etc. my code and uploading its adjusted versions. Nonetheless, please try contacting me first.Once more I only request crediting me for the work done.Workshop ID: 2719592131Mod ID: RS_WaterCisternMod ID: RS_WaterCistern_FR_OverwriteMod ID: RS_WaterCistern_KI5_Addon</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3175536048' target='_blank'>To-Do List (ID: 3175536048)</a><p>Things I hate:1.

I'm unable to work on modding for a bit, I got new medication and my work is taking off, so I promise I will get back to it, but not for a bit.They KnewThe Knox county incident was never a "random accident" or whatever the news was saying. Someone knew about this. They were there on the ground to observe the effects. What they didn't know, was how bad it was going to be.Search the map for a new rare zombie! This zombie has a medicine for the zombie infection on them. I wanted a zombie virus cure that combined danger with reward. There are several zombie cures out there, this one is my version. The spawn rate is configurable in the Sandbox Variables.TRANSLATIONSTraditional Chinese -Person BRussian -юmix&Agitatio&OpexTHIS MOD ADDSA new Hazmat SuitA new satchelZomboxivir: The inhalant that can purge you of the zombie virus. Further infections are unaffected.Zomboxycycline: These pills are used in a manner similar to Malaria prevention medication. These pills prevent infection for 24 hours. Don't forget to take your medicine! (This is disabled by default, you need to up the drop chance in the sandbox options if you want it to spawn)SANDBOX OPTIONSThe default for this zombie is 500. This means the mob is VERY RARE. The rest of the zombies in the default category have values between 20000 and 2000. The golfer zombie for instance (quite rare), has a score of 2000. Park rangers have a score of 10000.FAQ:Can this mod be installed on an existing game/server?Yep! Should just work. You will need to go to new areas to start seeing the zeds, or wait for respawns.Is this multiplayer ready?Yep!There are too many of this zombie!On single player: InstallTHISmod. Change the spawn rate.On multi player: See below.How do I configure the sandbox settings for a dedicated server?Load your dedicated server settings in the "host" option (click HOST instead of JOIN, or SOLO). Then, configure the sandbox settings there. Once you are done (lowest setting would be 1 instead of 50) save the settings, and exit host. Restart your server, and it should use the new sandbox settings. (TIP: This can be done even after the server has been going for a while, just close the server, load the file, edit and save. Next time you restart server, the settings will have changed).When should I use my dose?The best way to know when to use it, is when your character starts showing signs of infection! (Nausea, Nervousness)Do I need 1 dose for each bite?No. One dose will cure all infection on you. Even if you get bit 20 times.Why is the bite still there after I use the cure.Bite injuries will have to heal normally. The infection is the only thing removed.NEXT RELEASEZomboxycycline - Once a day pill to prevent infection. Will NOT cure an infection.

It works great paired with mods such asCryogenic winter,Eternal SnoworInfinite Weather. Mod won't be updated for a while since people don't like that as much and I don't have much time.The standard version works in SP and MP the latest builds!WARNINGDo not use the beta version (snowiswaterbeta), it's been broken for versions past 41.74 and I don't have time to fix it. If you want to use the mod, use the Standard version/mod file (snowiswater)FeaturesIncluded in theStandard Version( snowiswater ):Rain Barrels (both variants) are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%).Metal Barrels are filled up when it snows at a slower rate (50%).In theBeta Version( snowiswaterbeta ):Once again, do not use past version v41.75Items such as Pots and Buckets will also fill up when snowing with tainted water. This should work without a problem in MP, but it's labeled as a beta version since there could be some issues with it.Added configurable settings with "ModOptions" to change the ratio in which all the items fill up. The default is 50% but can be changed to 25%, 75% and even 100%.Planned features (WIP):Improved option to add "realism" to the snow/water limit and filling rate on barrels.Texture changes deppending on the weather.Beta IncompatibilitiesAs of patch 41.74, I have been informed that certain mods that add new items seem to break when the full version is working. I am currently working on a fix to adress these issues but it may take a while. For now, either switch to the "lite" version of my mod or try to avoid mods that add "fillable" containers, as they will be the ones causing the errors (i.e: Snake's mod pack).As of newer versions, the Beta version of the mod breaks certain actions due to the way the mod overides functions. I recommend to stop using the beta version and use the standard for now.If you liked the mod, please let me knowI really appreciate all the comments and positive feedback I've received.

No simple replacements, they're all their own items. Each agency based on what they looked like in 1993's Kentucky, to the best of our abilities. And much more to come...Outfits spawn on both zombies and in the map. NightScale has gone and mapped each area so that the Rosewood uniforms spawn in Rosewood, West Point police in West Point, Louisville in the city, the DOC sets spawn in the various jails and the prison and the same for the rest. No more generic uniforms for the whole map.Check the pinned discussions for more information.What is "Safe Mode" (STRS)?Safe mode greatly lessens the risk of mod conflicts or major issues. It's enabled by disabling the "custom zombie zones" sandbox option. Though expect situations that aren't so lore-friendly, i.e. Rosewood Police in Louisville.What is STO?SmallTownOverrides is a sandbox option that dynamically replaces specific zombies and vehicles so that the content is no longer limited to police stations.DiscordJoin for updates, mod support and to keep up with STFR & SVU's development!https://discord.gg/HeMWr3AkTkCreditsThis addon is a collab between NightScale, who does all the scripting and code, and söze, who does all the textures, with additional models by Peach.HUGE thanks tosharkfor letting us use the Police Belt model from his law enforcement mod.

Sinks can now store more water.April 04 - Bugfix, check release notes for more info.March 29 - Use pipe wrench (instead of propane torch) to build or remove pipes.March 21, 2024 - You can now pump water FROM rain collectors.March 13, 2024 - You can now connect whole buildings by connecting pipe to edge of the building.Plumbing ModThis mod lets you build a network of pipes to obtain water or fuel for various needs. You can transport water from rivers, lakes, wells, rain collectors and deliver it directly to barrels, connect whole houses to restore water after shutdown and also to irrigate farms. You can also transport fuel from gas stations to metal barrels.I spend hundreds of hours with this mod just for my pleasure. And if you like my work, you can[ko-fi.com]It is OK to add this mod in the middle of the game. It works for single and multiplayer games.How does this workPumpsEvery network must have at least one pump. Pumps are the only means of moving the water of fuel. In particular, this means, that the liquid will not move from barrels to anywhere else without a pumpBuilding a pumpTo build a pump, you need to access the "Plumbing" menu from the main context menu. The menu will be accessible once you have read Metalworking Magazine vol 2.Pumps must be build next to water or fuel sources. The only water sources pump can work with are: a water tile (lake or river), a well or a rain collector barrel. Fuel sources are gas pumps.Once you have built the pump, select "Attach water source" or "Attach fuel source".  Water tiles (lakes, rivers) will provide with tainted water, wells with fresh water.Now you can click "Pump info" to see details about the pump.Powering the pumpIn order to function, the pump needs electricity. You can use a power generator, but Immersive Solar Arrays mod will also work. Global power before blackout will not work. A running pump will consume 0.09L/h of fuel. When you open "Generator info" the pump will be listed as "Other". Click "Turn on" to start the pump.Pump efficiencyThe pump you built, will have a starting efficiency depending on you metalworking skill. You will get 10% of efficiency for every skill level. Pump efficiency will very slowly decrease over time, lowering the volume of liquid pumped. 100% efficiency is 12L/10 mins. Pumps below 20% will be additionally susceptible to emergency stops or in rare cases will start fire. Never build pumps close to your base!  A 100% healthy pump needs several months to wear out completely. Repair the pump to regain the efficiency.Water filteringBy default, a pump provides with tainted water. If you want the pump to deliver drinkable water, you can click "Add Charcoal Filter" if you have charcoal in your inventory. Water filter will be slowly used over time. Use pump info to see the current status of the filter. Water is filtered as long the status of the filter is above 0%. When pumping fuel, filters do not play any role.CollectorsCollectors are objects that have the ability of storing liquids. This mod has an explicit list of in-game vanilla object that are recognized as water collectors. This list includes small and big rain collector barrels, sinks, baths, toilets and washing machines. To collect fuel, build a Fuel Tank. To fill the collector a pipe must reach to it.Connecting BuildingsIf the pipe reaches edge of the building, then all water collectors on every level of that building will be filled. The water will fill collectors one by one until full, not paralelly. Self-built houses cannot be connected. Each building must be connected individually, because building are ends of the network and will not relay water further. "Plumb" option is not necessary at all. If you pump tainted water, it will also be tainted in the sinks.PipesPipes are the only means of transportation liquid from pumps to collectors. Pipes must be placed in a consecutive manner forming a pipeline. No other objects will relay liquid. In particular, this means, that if there is a barrel between the pipes, if will receive the water, but it will not relay it any further. Similarly a connected building is the end of the network and can't relay water to other structures.Building pipesTo build a pipe, use the "Plumbing" menu again.The pipes you place will adjust visually automatically. The first pipe will be a cross, but the next one you place next to it will fix both pipes. You can build a simple network, or network with multiple forks, you can even make a loop but then you computer may explode.Pipes can be built on multiple floors. Check the screenshot gallery how to achieve this. Just place the pipes in the shown order.If you build a pipe close to a collector object, the pipe should snap to it correctly. If that does not happen it means that the object is not recognized as a collector.To remove a pipe click "Remove Pipe", you will get you pipe item back.Water movementIf the pump is on, and the pipes are connected to it, liquid will start flowing. Every in-game 10 minutes, liquid will be transported to the end(s) of the network.If you networks forks, the liquid amount will be split. The split may be unequal in certain situations. For example if there are 13 units of water to be split across 2 pipes, one will receive 6 units, and the other will get 7 units. If there are too many consecutive splits, some pipes will not receive liquid at all, that happens whenthere is only 1 unit of liquid that needs to be split.You network can split liquid, but also join streams from multiple pipelines. Note, that the pipe however has a maximum throughput that is equal to the amount of five 100% efficient pumps. Joining streams strategy is effective if you want to transport large amount of liquid from multiple pumps using one shared pipeline.If you mix gasoline and water in one network, the network will not work.ValvesEvery pipeline intersection has valves that can be changed. Valves are present on each ending or a pipe, so a T-shape pipe intersection has 3 valves, and the cross shape pipe has 4 valves. Valves are named by their placement, so there can be north, east, west and south valve.Each of these valves can operate in two modesTwo-way valve - will allow liquid to flow in both directionsOne-way valve (receiver) - will allow liquid to flow in one direction, it will allow liquid only to come in this pipe, and not come out to pipe connected to this end.Valve settings will have impact on how liquid is split or merged on intersections.To access valve information use context menu on the intersection and click "Valve info". This information is updated not immediately, but every 10 in-game minutes.Similarly, to change valve settings, use context menu on the intersection and click "Change valves".Farms irrigationFarms built one square next to straight pipes will be watered automatically. Some portion of transported water will be used but only if the plant needs it. It works on vanilla farms,but also with other mods using standard farming system such as Mo Crops or Farmable Trees.TroubleshootingIf there are problems, launch the game in a debug mode. In context menu, there will be more options you can use for debugging such as a map of your network.Incompatibility with Hydrocraft, fix:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3152142389Workshop ID: 3118159023Mod ID: Plumbing</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3146046428' target='_blank'>Plumb Helper PLUS (ID: 3146046428)</a><p>Check out the infomercials!Plumb HelperPlumb Helper PLUSA SIMPLE TOOL FOR  A SIMPLE JOB!With apipe wrenchin your inventory, an option will appear in your context menu.

Lightweight, nimble, cheap, and hilariously unsafe.'- GabesterSupportsNightscale's Standardized Vehicle Upgrades!Originating from the videogame BeamNG.Drive, the Ibishu Covet was Ibishu's first ever attempt of catering their Japanese automobiles to the American market. Designed specifically with the intentions of going against the likes of the Chevalier Dart, the Covet manages to surpass the competition thanks to its incredible versatility. It sold like wildfire across the entire contiguous nation, being the perfect car for anyone who just needed a commuter car back and forth that wouldn't break the bank. Despite only being produced in the states from 1986 to 1992, a fair number of these little buggers can still be found brand new, having been vastfully oversupplied for the country.Retailed Models:1.5 Dx:The absolute baseline trim of the Covet. Designed specifically to be so utterly cheap and basic that it pushes the absolute limits of what the U.S. could federally allow at the time. The end result was this glorified armchair-on-wheels, featuring the bare bones of what a car can do, and an engine so unbelievably basic that you'd have a harder time understanding how to detach the car's door than to disassemble the engine. On the upside though, it was one of the last vehicles you could buy new for under 7,000$. Expect to find this car amongst anyone living directly at the poverty line, either just needing a car to get from place to place, or your local crackhead who likely stole it from an impound lot.1.5 Dxi:This was what Ibishu called their 'Standard Line', being the single most popular trim of the whole Covet fleet. It had some vehicle comforts, as well as a slightly improved engine that is instead fuel injected rather than carbureted. This resulted in better mileage, power, and overall reliability, at the cost of not being as mechanic-friendly as what the 1.5 Dx offered. Expect to find this car literally anywhere, from grocery stores to rental car lots, from the blue collar to the white collar.1.5 Lxi:The Lxi was designed to be Ibishu's more premium trimline of hatchbacks, featuring an entirely overhauled appearance to let it stand apart from its conventional counterparts. Although it was originally intended for businessmen who were fuel-conscious during its design phase of the early to mid 1980s, by the time of its debut, the 1986 Oil Glut hit the states, letting you go back to driving six litre V8s again with little repercussions to your wallet. This didn't interfere with the sales of the Lxi too much though, as it was found to be quite a very popular car amongst retirees who wanted a timid, practical car that wouldn't scare them. It was a fair tradeoff, but as a result a decent number of these vehicles had already begun to start rotting away on many used car lots, barely having been driven at all as a result.1.5 Zxi:With the Zxi being Ibishu's first step into the 'hot hatch' market, it was certainly a milestone for the company as this was unveiled. Its high-performance, dual overhead camshaft engine allowed it to propel much, much more quicker than the rest of its competitors, and was even able to stand its ground against many of America's newest vehicles thanks to just how light it was. This newfound performance did mean that it was much more harder to maintain such an exotic motor, but it didn't stop the public from buying it. This model was found to be quite popular to either the upper class who were in the process of having a midlife crisis but didn't want to splurge on a Cossette, or the trailerpark pimp that likely bought it under a massive pile of credit card debt trying to show off.1.5 Zxi Special Edition:For the state of Kentucky, this was Ibishu's top-of-the-line model of their entire range. It was the only one out of the lot that actually had alloy wheels compared to the steel hubs of all the others, as well as a sleek livery that stretched all around the car. It's engine was more beefier, the suspension more stiffer, and the exhaust more louder. It was so illustrious that this specific model wasn't even sold alongside its standard Zxi counterpart, you had to order it directly from Ibishu through a physical catalogue that would get shipped directly to you from Japan. This did make it quite an expensive vehicle, but its downsides hardly mattered for those who could afford this machine.Workshop ID: 2938319441Mod ID: IbishuCovet</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778456849' target='_blank'>Harry's Tow Truck - Chevalier Rhino (Fixed 41.66+) (ID: 2778456849)</a><p>Adds theChevalier Rhino tow truckto the game!This is a replacement for the broken mod:Harry's Functional Tow Truck - Chevalier RhinoMy changes to the mod itself:- Removed dependency of the broken Better Towing Mod- Removed any functionality connected to the Better Towing Mod- Fixed the colors of the lightbar- Changed some of the stats to make the suspension a little bit stronger- The mod contains now only the vehiclePlease notice that I needed to remove the dependecy to the original mod as well.My other mod fitting to this:Mod description from harrycheez:ATTENTION!Unfortunately due to multiple problems in my life right now I will not be able to mod for a while.

Body-on-frame construction, a V8 engine, and a heavy duty live axle rear suspension make it more than adequate for police work or taxi service.'- GabesterSupportsNightscale's Standardized Vehicle Upgrades!Originating from the videogame BeamNG.Drive, the Gavril name brand in the United States is an icon of the nation's booming car industry, and the Grand Marshal was no different of a masterpiece. Released at the turn of the new decade, the Grand Marshal quickly made up the majority of full-size sedan sales across the country, surpassing what Chevalier or Dash could ever do for this prestigious, yet surprisingly affordable landboat.Retailed Models:V8 Standard:The regular trim of their entire range, which even then was still a grand purchase. You got a fat V8 at the front, power in the back, a body larger than the Nyala in the middle, and much more spread across everywhere else. It was this specific model that did make up the large majority of all their sales to the public, so you can expect to find this automobile pretty much anywhere you could think a car would be.V8 Luxe:The Luxe model was namely designed specifically for Gavril's rapidly aging market base. With their most loyal customers having been born during or after the second World War to see the company build their way up to the present day, the Luxe model was modelled after the vehicles of the time to create a more familiar shape to them. Chrome-lined bumpers, whitewall tyres, and a deliberately more bouncy ride mimicked that of automobiles of the mid-century, but it still had modern technologies dotted everywhere else that wasn't visible for the seniors to see.V8 Sport:This was basically just the top-of-the-line for the general public to get. For this model, the company instead honed in on their veritable NASCAR history, putting a specialized team to recreate the Marshal to mimick those on the tracks. The result was this monster; which had an even larger V8 engine, stiffened suspension, thicker tyres and visual decorations that faintly call home to their racing life. It was quite excessive in its performance, but if there was one thing the American public loved aside from freedom, it was to be excessive.Fleet Models:Federal Use:Police Package:For Gavril's debut of the Grand Marshal, there was a big focus by the company to manufacture a portion towards the nation's police force. For the regular police package, it mainly came with everything the Nyala counterpart had, but with some notable extras. A sturdy bullbar out on the front, grill-mounted emergency lights, and a properly heavy-duty suspension system allowed this model to surge ahead basically just on sheer durability. As such, many rural county police departments had started introducing this vehicle to their fleets, namely citing their ruggedness to keep up with suspects both on and off-road if absolutely needed.Undercover Package:The undercover package was quite literally just the police package from before, but this time with an emphasis on laying inconspicuous. Though the illusion was blatantly broken with the bullbar still out front, the emergency lights were instead concealed off to the rear windshield and grill that at least made it not noticable as a law enforcement vehicle from far away. This particular fleet vehicle was rather popular either with many detective agencies across the nation, or federal agents who had noticed something going on down in the Knox County.Interceptor Package:This police model to put it bluntly was completely off the walls unheard of, and was a risk Gavril was actively making to see how it would turn out. With a deliberately lowered suspension and a ridiculously beefy engine throwing the car at the speeds of a Cossette, this thing was basically the V8 Sport model on steroids in its design. Despite this though, many interstate enforcements and state troopers had utterly adored this particular model, and the state of Kentucky was no different in quickly inaugurating this car on the many interstates darting across the state for the specific use in car chases and rapid response. Despite this, the cruiser still proved to be Gavril's least sold variant of the Marshal, but it was a damn good Marshal.Civilian Use:Taxi Package:For the year of 1993, Gavril wanted to then try pushing their fleet sales to civilian companies instead, kicking it off with a taxi refit. With a slightly facelifted design compared to its 1990 editions, this model was designed specifically in order to replace Nyala's aging market share that was ripe for Gavril to take. The state of Kentucky in particular did take the oppurtunity to open a four year long contract with Gavril to phase out Chevalier from their transport fleets, but due to a small issue known as the 'Knox Event', only the inaugural models ever managed to get introduced into their lines.Workshop ID: 2887394700Mod ID: GavrilGrandMarshal</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783580134' target='_blank'>Garbage Truck (ID: 2783580134)</a><p>Streets have too much trash on them?Wanna help make a cleaner apocalypse?Try out the "Let's Get Wasted Managment" truckBase truck model by Filibuster Rhymes from his modFilibuster Rhymes' Used Cars!Animations by Mr.MacbethIf you use the radial menu (V) on the truck when you have items in the back,you can destroy them forever! if the back is at least HALF full, you will geta trash cube(tm) to spawn.

It is implied the potatoes are kept in somewhere cool.Meatwork details :All meat related recipes will accept meat by the unit - no matter how it has been cut.Meat can becanned,salted,smokedor eaten in any other way you want.All bigger animals(FromImmersive Huntingmod) , depending on their size, will produce certain amount of steak slabs, leather strips and bones when butchered.Big steak slabs can be cut into smaller pieces to be shared with a friend, stored, cooked or traded more easily.Small trapped/hunted animal, both from vanilla and Hunting Mod are butchered the vanilla way.Raw canned meat needs to be heated in fire so it will change to normal canned meat.Smoked meat/fish needs to be smoked for about 10-12 hours. Lasts 6-10 days.Salted meat can also be made from various meat types. Lasts 15-20 days.You can also mine salt and various other stuff with my :Dynamic Miningmod.Smoking/Salting Tutorial: PZ has such thing as units - these units can be either measured in drainable items as delta or they can be hunger value on food items. To prepare your meat for smoking/salting you need ONE unit of whatever kind of RAW MEAT, this will create you a "starter item". The whole system is not not new or made up by me but the usual evolved recipe(Stir Fry, Pie, Soup etc etc). Only difference is that in my version you need to craft the initial item from the food itself - there is no other item involved. Now you can click on that new item and start adding more meat to it, until its full and then cook it over the fire.Brewing details :Brew Ethanol from potatoes/corn and yeast.Brew Vinegar from ethanol and vegetables.Brewing and canning equipment such as wooden barrels and can sealers can be either looted or crafted.Just make a brew and place the barrel on the ground and leave it be.Ethanol takes 15 days to get ready.Vinegar takes 10 days to get ready.When the brew is ready, you can open the barrel while holding 5 empty bottles and voilaa - you get 5 bottles of ethanol/vinegar and your barrel can be used for the next brew.Ethanol+Water can be mixed into vodka.Ethanol can be also used as fuel.You can use the vodka as a drink or to disinfect stuff.Other :Sweet Juice can be stomped out of certain veggies and used as sugar - it also produces yeast as a by product.Mushrooms can be stomped straight to yeast.Cook tallow from any animal meat.Make candles from tallow. Candles last 6 times longer.Tallow can be used in cooking recipes as an oil/lard/margarine.Glue can be made out of bones and leather. Glue lasts 2 times longer.Soap can be made out of animal meat. Soap lasts 5 times longer.Make dried berries out of strawberries.Foragable salt rocks that can be crushed into salt(Found in Forests/Vegetation/Farmlands).Refining Biogas(Propane) from all sorts of food.You can empty all cans(Vanilla too) from food(Even rotten).Tweaked strategic lootable food nutrition values(Canned/Dried/Chips/Sweets)Realistic calories for various vanilla foods. I also suggest usingCalorie burn tweakerandWeight change speedto make the overall hunger system more balanced.Everything related to canning, jarring, smoking, salting and brewing needs a certain skill + a recipe book.Updates to this mod are 100% savegame friendly and wont break anything. Works in MP and is friendly with both vanilla and other mods.Credits :Russian translation - Thank youaxelroadmanThis is part of... :Project Realistic Overhaul- Set of mods I've created that will overhaul the vanilla game experience to be more hardcore and true to life, but on the other hand leaves you the option to make it through and survive.

This mod aims to consolidate several different ideas into a single mod. This mod does not remove the default recipe for jarring but adds two alternative ways to jar and pickle food more reflective of reality.Jarred Food:Jarred food now returns the lid and the jar when opened.Jarring food only requires water but still needs to be cooked. The requirement for vinegar and sugar is removed.Jarred food will last up to 1 year until stale and 2 years until rotten (Default in the vanilla game is 3 months until rotten).Pickled Foods:Pickling food requires a lid, jar, water, vinegar, salt and sugar.They do not require cooking and will keep food fresh for 3 years and from rotting up to 5 years.Pickled food are more in-line with the vanilla recipe but with a greatly increased shelf life to better reflect the difficulty involved in acquiring all the ingredients to pickle.Preserving Meat and Fruit:You can jar or pickle meat in the same way as outlined above. Only works on food acquired through fishing or trapping (Rabbit, Bird etc).You can create jerky by combining salt and 2 butchered meats. The final result will add the hunger values together but can not be any better than -100.You can create fruit jam and marmalade using a jar, varying quantities of fruit, and sugar.All fruit jam and marmalade will give a jar and lid when eaten.Stale and rotten food will add sadness and boredom to jerky, jam and marmalade, but rotten ingredients will not add food poisoning.Additional Changes:Loot rate for jars, lids, boxes of jars, vinegar, salt and sugar have all been increased.Increased the variety of containers that jars and salt can spawn in.Jar freshness is 99% accurate to its contents. Works with eris food expiry mod**Add recipe to put jars back into a boxAlternate mod to require reading a few magazines to unlock the recipes.Bugs:Vanilla jar recipes are still available but there is no clean way to remove them. Just ignore them.Instead of storing jarred food hunger values individually, it's all averaged together and given back averaged too. Recipe code doesn't let you operate on individual items that come out of the jar, so this is the only way to keep the input equal to the output.**Using Eris Food Expiry mod will display jarred food expiration date incorrectly when uncooked. You need to cook the jars to get the 2 year until rotten trait, otherwise you could open a fresh jar to receive rotten contents. Debug menu displays correct values. Once the jar of food is cooked the Eris Expiry mod will work correctly and display accurate data.Having a way to preserve food for long periods of time seemed to be a balancing issue to the devs but considering how common canned food can be even on rare loot settings being able to stockpile farmed food at the expense of rare resources (jars etc.) seems balanced to us.Other mods that work well with this one:AnaLGiN's Renewable Food Resourcesfor foraging and growing ingredientsJarring Made Easyfor crafting jarring items and ingredientsChoose only one Mod ID! Mags locks all the recipes behind 5 magazines - one for jerky, one for jam, one for marmalade, one for jars of vegetables and one for jars of meat.

The design process of the fairly inconspicuous vehicle had some of the best engineers Germany had to offer when working on it, and the result was nothing short of staggering on what they managed to achieve on such a fairly standard unibody chassis.Oddly enough, the car had actually sold better in North America than it did in its home continent, something that ETK themselves especially wasn't expecting. Its overseas exports were in fact so overlooked, the large majority of their marketing was left completelay untranslated for some bizzare reason, but it seemed to add to the vehicle's inherently peculiar, but fascinating appeal for the majority of middle-class Americans to have on their front driveways, almost like a fashion statement for the time.Nomenclature GuideUnlike many other car models of the time, ETK took a more regulated, borderline bureaucratic approach to designating their fleet of vehicles. While it may seem completely random at times, the principles that they used for governing each model was actually quite intuitive.Number Prefix:2400:Features the standard 2.4L Inline-6 engine, a great all-rounder for whatever you really need out of an ETK. On its own, this acts as the vehicle's base model trim, being relatively nothing special apart from being a European import to show off to your neighbours.3000:Unlike the 2400, this prefix indicates that the engine underneath has been upgraded to a 3.0L equivalent, intended for a much smoother, luxurious ride for the consumer. This engine type was only offered with either the 'i' or 'ix' coefficients, but not the TTSport treatment, as the added turbo would actually produce so much raw torque that there wasn't any transmission that could sustain the strain for any prolonged periods of time, especially for those equipped with the AWD platform.Letter Coefficients:i:ETK's signature trim upgrade to the I-Series, so much so that this upgrade is quite literally what gave the car its idiosyncratic name in the first place. This enhancement namely focused on the exterior of the car, featuring such things as fog lights, headlight-mounted windshield wipers, an extended front lip, and on pre-facelift models, a stretched around chrome trim. This upgrade was not just the definitive ETK package to have, but it also acted as the baseplate to all the other upgrades that follow after.x:ETK's all-terrain package, indicated by the four ends of the letter 'x' to signify the car's greatest selling point; it's full-time All-Wheel-Drive system. This sort of platform was completely unheard of at the time to be installed into a traditional mid-sized sedan, yet ETK still went ahead with it to mass success. This upgrade gave the vehicle unrivalled performance on rough surfaces compared to any of its competitor models in the same price bracket, and on pre-facelift models even gave it anti-lock braking, giving it even more control around tight bends and otherwise hazardous circumstances. This upgrade sold especially well in the northern U.S. states upwards into Canada for its excellent winter driving performance, something that ETK focused namely on when creating the innovative drivetrain in the first place.t:ETK's performance upgrade; the 't' quite literally just being abbreviated from 'turbogeladen' or turbocharged. This particular model was primarily handled by the company's performance division; 'TTSport', giving the car some much needed suspension and chassis tweaks for more intensive driving, topped off with a modest spoiler on the tail end of it to act as the cherry on top for this rowdy machine. The TTSport lineup was offered either with RWD or AWD, so you could either do some sick burnouts with it, or send it around the local track to beat out the competitors with little to no trouble depending on your heart's desire.Evolution:A limited-production homologation model offered hand-in-hand in a joint effort by ETK and Brigsby, a third-party German tuning company to create the ultimate machine for use in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, an annual touring car championship, in which one of the baseline rules was that all participating track cars had to have a street-legal, civilian production model. The end result was this absolute monster, featuring some of the most exorbitant, if not ridiculous body panels the late 1980s really had to offer. On the track however, it was an utter beast that basically just destroyed the competition without even breaking much as a sweat. For its mandatory road legal models however, it was generally unknown how many of these toned-down racecars were even sold to the general public. But if there was one thing that was known, it was the fact that this thing was powerful. Real damn powerful.Workshop ID: 3004300621Mod ID: ETKI</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804531012' target='_blank'>Draw On The Map - Free Hand Drawing (ID: 2804531012)</a><p>Draw On The Mapadds a new free hand drawing tool to the game map!This tool allows you to freely draw lines of any shape.

Mod values can be configured in the sandbox options. I believe this approach is more balanced and fair. (See screenshot)Because of this change, existing saves will revert to using default values (Min: 500, Max: 2000, Consider Traits: true, Consider Occupations: true). This is the only way to make saves backwards compatible.Exhausted from your character always panicking when they see a zombie even though they slaughtered countless zombies? Then this mod is for you.What It DoesAfter you kill 500 (Modifiable through Sandbox Options) zombies through melee or gun combat (no fire burns), you get the chance to become desensitized. This chance increases as you get more zombie kills.If you reach 2000 (Modifiable through Sandbox Options) zombie kills, you automatically become desensitized.Some traits and professions also change the chance that you'll become desensitized.When you become desensitized, mutually exclusive traits will be removed (Cowardly, Agoraphobic, Claustrophobic, Hemophobic).You have a chance to gain this trait at midnight (00:00).Considered Traits that change the chance of gaining the traitPostive: Brave, HunterNegative: Cowardly, Agoraphobic, Claustrophobic, Hemophobic, PacifistConsidered Occupations that change the chance of gaining the traitPolice Officer, Fireman, Park Ranger, Security Guard, Doctor, NurseFrequent AnswersThis mod should work with existing saves.Possible ImprovementsAny suggestions, let me know and I'll think about it.Check out my other modsStart Scenario - Vehicle Nomad Mod CollectionSilent Hill Radio REDUXPermafrostBecome DesensitizedBecome BraveKingsmouth in KYSlocan Lake REDUXCreditsSpanish Translations -https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkorinho/Russian Translations (and help with testing) -https://steamcommunity.com/id/ladykillery/Portuguese (Brazilian) Translations -https://steamcommunity.com/id/701040Chinese (Simplified & Traditional) Translations -https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112234913I do mod commissions - Discord: _mon.key[ko-fi.com]Workshop ID: 2627877543Mod ID: BecomeDesensitized</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808679062' target='_blank'>Backpack Borders (ID: 2808679062)</a><p>Backpack Bordersis a small UI tweak that adds a background and border to the container buttons in Zomboid's inventory windows.The change makes it easier to see each individual button, particularly when the player is using dark coloured backpack items, such as a black duffel bag.If you enjoy my mods, consider supporting me on Ko-fi![ko-fi.com]Or, just come check out some previews of what I'm working on next!Other Mods To Check Out!Workshop ID: 2808679062Mod ID: VISIBLE_BACKPACK_BACKGROUND</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782258356' target='_blank'>Autotsar Tuning Atelier - Petyarbuilt 379 (ID: 2782258356)</a><p>[patreon.com]Petyarbilt 379, also calledPetya, is the dream of many American truckers.The long hood, impressive grille and bumper, massive mufflers and air filter housings, abundance of chrome, polished aluminum and stainless steel make the hearts of connoisseurs beat faster.The local transportation vehicles are equipped with a short two-man aluminum cabin.On long haulage routes there are tractors equipped with Ofiget' Cab Sleeper System.

The bow looks different to other players when it is drawn (A fix was attempted but with only one instance of the game running, for lack of RAM)).Not working with a controller (For lack of a controller to test with. Oh, a controller can be emulated).In the latest game version the arrows do not pitch up or down.(I am currently not playing project zomboid or modding it much though)You assemble arrows with the right-click menu, like with firearm attachments, instead of with the recipe menu.How fast your character can nock an arrow and how well he can aim depend on his archery skill (and panic and tiredness). Your character can start with the "Archer" trait. Hitting targets is easier when they are close than when they are far away. An arrow is nocked with the reload button. The bow uses the same controls as firearms, so you can check the controls page. This mod shows green circles over the targets' heads as part of a custom targeting system.It's not exactly balanced right now, but it might be a bit of fun, maybe. (This sentence was typed long ago :/ )A wooden bow can be made by the character. There is also a compound bow without a recipe.Bow: Plank + knifeBow string: TwineArrow shaft: Sturdy stick + knifeArrowhead: Either a nail hammered against a big hammerhead; or spoon/butterknife and saw; or a sharpned stoneFletchings: DuctTape or something + scissors; or from butchering a birdThis mod uses its own aiming system, so it doesn't intermesh with any other mod that does things with aiming systems unless the other mod is specifically programmed to do so. For example it probably does not collaborate with Advanced Trajectory.Possible additions (Though actually perhaps I am unlikely to put the time into doing most of these. Also archery is going to be added to the base game which makes me extra unlikely to so much more work on this mod):. Adding more detail to bow making, like different sorts of wood and different bow designs and humidity (Probably not. It would ideally involve finding how to get the Lua to distinguish conifer wood from deciduous wood).. Balancing (Two different ways of aiming - looking down the arrow, and not looking down the arrow. The Archer trait giving good looking-down-the-arrow skill. Looking down the arrow being slow to aim and bad against moving targets. Instinctive archery being good for hitting moving targets, and at shooting without spending time aiming). Seeing arrows stuck in zombies (partly done). A quiver (done. added compatibility with another mod's quiver). Translations (got some Russian and Korean). Other sorts of bow like recurve laminated and composite and mechanical, and stone-shooting (added one). Shooting at zombies lower down than the archer.. Shooting at superb and subpar survivors.. Target practice.. Getting tired from drawing the bow. Having separate aim and draw buttons. The sounds someone made (or maybe not eew). Shooting over fences. A bow holster. Shooting molotovs. Strings snapping. Making the compound bow look better on the back with a bag. Aiming with a controller (using a controller emulator)Acknowledgements:. To make the arrow move and detect collisions I used Driving Cars Mod by nolanritchie to start with, where the item is picked up and put down again to move it.. The lua tooltip things were originally copied from something like ORGM.Zomboid log file for error messages:HardDrive:\Users\Username\Zomboid\LogsSomeone made this mod for this mod:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824362101"Bow and Arrow Addon" "QoL Addon"There is also a mod for alternative drawing. And there's another one that implements that mod differently. This code has not yet been merged with this mod, my apology for being tardy :cCompatible with the quiver in the mod "Better Belts". The quiver makes nocking an arrow a bit faster too.There's a mod that does something with this mod and others. (I wonder what I meant by this line)In case you want to know how to do things with this mod's modular arrow system, There's an example mod that adds a glass arrowhead and things in the "discussions" section of this page.I remember there was a mod that makes changes to this mod like adding flint arrowheads and more ways of making fletchings but it's not listed in this mod description, which is inconvenient.I'm all right with mods of this mod being made, like retextures and other things, and also mod packs.Workshop ID: 2208315526Mod ID: MandelaBowAndArrow</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776318649' target='_blank'>Handmade Weapons [41.78] (ID: 2776318649)</a><p>Handmade WeaponsThis mod adds the following manufacturable melee weapons:-Combat Rod.Recipe: Branch/plank, knife/sharpened stone.-Stone Handaxe.Recipe: Branch, sharpened stone, cloth scrap.-Wooden Club.Recipe: Log, saw.-Wooden Club with Nails.Recipe: Wooden Club, 5 nails, hammer.-Handmade Baseball Bat.Recipe: Carpentry level 6, 2 logs, saw, chisel (1 use).-Barbed Wire Handmade Bat.Recipe: Handmade Bat, barbed wire, hammer.-Handmade Bat with Nails.Recipe: Handmade Bat, 5 nails, hammer.-Wooden Sword.Recipe: Carpentry level 8, 2 logs, saw, chisel (1 use).-Barbed Wire Baseball Bat.Recipe: Baseball Bat, barbed wire, hammer.-Improved Stone Axe.Recipe: Plank, sharpened stone, cloth scrap, knife.-Thechiselis used for some crafting and can be found nailed to zombies or inside containers:It also adds the possibility ofsharpening stones(using 2 stones and 4 units of water) and making awooden mallet(using 2 planks, 4 nails, hammer and a knife or chisel).The mod tries to be faithful to the original content so they are not very strong or durable weapons, although they can become so if the character has decent skill levels.If you find any bugs don't hesitate to let me know.

These antiques were typically kept as ironic playthings by rich hobbyists with an extra couple thousand dollars to throw around. Some were in the possession of paranoid preppers, junkies, and gangbangers who anticipated a time when the knives would come out. Pawnshops were known to certify and trade these swords from time to time, and the Louisville Art Gallery was running an exhibition on fine smithing when the virus broke out. If one is lucky, they might also run into some unfortunate survivor's sword out in the wild, stuck in a zombie. Acquiring a Bastard Sword will turn your character into a demon, able to clear hordes of the undead silently and efficiently.----The purpose of this mod is to address a gap that I feel is present in the melee weapon meta. There is room for a durable endgame long blade weapon. Unfortunately, most sword and weapon mods on the Workshop include several other items that can throw off the balance of the game. This mod is intended to fill the long blade niche while keeping things as vanilla as possible. The Bastard Sword will provide your character with the rampaging fury of the Katana for much longer than one 10 minute engagement. The tradeoff is that these swords are rarer, heavier, and slower then the Katana.The Bastard Sword reachs further (1.5 vs 1.4) than the Katana, but shorter than the Machete Spear (1.55). It has higher damage (10 vs 8), higher crit chance (45% vs 30%), and more multi hits (5 vs 3) than the Katana. However, it swings slower (4 vs 3) and is heavier (3.5 vs 2). The Bastard Sword is much more durable (1/45 vs 1/15), with a higher max condition (13 vs 10). Where Katanas will break after a couple hundred zombies, the Bastard Sword will last for a couple thousand.----There is a very high chance of finding a few swords the 18 display cases of the Louisville Art Gallery and the 13 display cases in the gallery next door (west). From my testing of melee weapon loot settings; rare(0-3), normal(1-4), abundant(5-9). Common is untested. If you play on extremely rare don't expect to find one.After the Art Gallery, the Bastard Sword is best searched for in Pawn Shops, where they are roughly half as common as Katanas.Swords will spawn in zombies after 90 days. The chance of finding a sword in a zombie is roughly 20% that of a Katana.A list of the distribution tags;>Antiques.items, 0.01>BarCounterWeapon.items, 0.05>DrugShackWeapons.items, 0.5>GolfLockers.items, 0.01>Hobbies.items, 0.001>PawnShopGunsSpecial.items, 0.5>PawnShopKnives.items, 0.1>LockerClassy.items, 0.01>WardrobeMan.items, 0.001>WardrobeManClassy.items, 0.01>MeleeWeapons.items, 0.5>PlankStashMisc.items, 0.1>StripClubDressers.items, 0.005>GolfTruckBed.items, 0.1>DoctorTruckBed.items, 0.1>SurvivalistTruckBed.items, 0.1>ProceduralDistributions.list.SwordCrate = {rolls = 1,items = {"BastardSword", 8,>local SwordCratedistributionTable = {all = {displaycase = {procedural = true,procList = {{name="SwordCrate", min=25, max=25, forceForRooms="Gallery", weightChance=100},----This is my first mod.

More and more houses popped up as well as a few small businesses that decided to try their luck in this little town. The growth of AshenWood was well underway when people started hearing about the outbreak. Most people grabbed what they could carry and tried to make it out, leaving everything else behind, causing the growth of the town to halt just as fast as it had started. A few tough people however, decided to stand their ground and fortify what they could in an attempt to fight off whatever this virus would bring with it.For bugs being fixed in a future update, please checkhttps://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2820363371/3421060714402040961/Most of the buildings are custom made for this map.Some of the map features:- Residental houses.- Apartments.- Cabins.- Survivor hideouts.- Entertainment.- Gas stations.- Storage Units.- Grocery stores.- Tools and farming stores.- School.- Church.- Construction sites.- Gun store.- Police station.- Medical, doctor and pharmacy.- Fire station.- Auto shop.- Resturants and bars.- Lots of water for fishing.- Car spawns.- Trees and foraging zones.And lots of little secrets for you to find on your own!BEWARE, This map includes buildings with lots of tricky corners and cramped spaces, watch your step!Bikes, junkpiles, decor items and trash, can be picked up and moved, or destroyed with sledgehammer.Conflicts with other map mods that uses the same cells (38,38 - 38,37)If the map isnt there in your game, you have to start a new run.This is my first map mod, let me know what you think, good or bad :)Dont forget to rate and favorite!Workshop ID: 2820363371Mod ID: AshenwoodMap Folder: Ashenwood</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522891356' target='_blank'>Bedford Falls (ID: 522891356)</a><p>Welcome to Bedford Falls.

Since you were little, you always knew the end was near. You didn't know when or  how, but it didn't matter. You decided that you were going to survive.After years of work and sacrifice, your life's work was finished: A huge doomsday bunker with everything you would ever need to survive the end of the world.But you were too late. One day too late. Your generator, water purifier and all of the supplies needed to survive were supposed to arrive on July 10, but now, July 9, the roads are closed and the dead are rising and feasting on the living. So you have a perfectly safe doomsday bunker, but no supplies.This is what you get for being a...LAST MINUTE PREPPERWelcome to this idea I had after playing with a lot of mods with overpowered bases. There's a lot of amazing bases and bunkers in the workshop, but I have a problem with all of those: Too much loot.Let's be honest, the best part of this game is looting houses and shops. Why would anyone risk themselvs in endless loot runs if your giant base already had everything you needed to survive?So, I made this: A big bunker (as big as it can be to be powered by only one generator) with tons of storage space but with almost no real loot, for those players who enjoy looting but not building a base.There's two maps withing this mod. One of them is the old version of the mod (legacy) and it's only there to save old games from file corruption (or you could use it anyways if you think that the garage is too big).Use just one of them at any time(if you use both, one will overwrite the other and bad things could happen)The bunker is divided in the following areas:Garage: The entrance of the bunker. It has a lot of space for vehicles and a mechanical workshop.Library: To store all your books and magazines.Bar: A cozy place to store all of your alcohol and to have a good time with friends.Armory: A lot of space for guns for those who enjoy playing with Brita's mods.Hospital: To store all your medicine and to recover from close encounters with zeds.Laboratory: Intended to be used with the zombie virus vaccine mod.Food storage: A big storage area behind the kitchen with two freezers and a big refrigerator.House: This is the only place where you will find loot in the bunker. Thanks to three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, an office, a living room and a dining room, the american dream has never been more alive (unlike the rest of humanity).FAQ- Where is the bunker?South of Louisville, take a look at the pictures I uploaded to know the best route to take after passing the military checkpoint- It doesn't work on multiplayerYou are installing it wrong. To enable a mod in multiplayer, you have to add it twice. First in the workshop section of the settings, and then on the mod section. Then, make sure the required mod, Daddy Dirkie Dirk's tiles, is enabled. This map has to be loadedAFTERthe vanilla map (there's and entire section on the server settings dedicated to this).- Can I add it to an existing save?Like any other map mod, it is recommended start a new game to use it. You can still add it to an already existing save if you didn't visit the cell- Does the bunker have (insert random feature that vanilla buildings don't have)?No. There's no additional code involved in this mod. The bunker works like any other building on the map, but bunker shaped. Does it have infinite electricity? No, you need a generator. Does it have inifinite water? No, you need to plumb water collectors. Are the entrance doors indestructible? No, they are literally just garage doors.For any other questions you might have, just ask yourself "does any vanilla buildings do this?" and that will be your answer.Cell: 44x12Workshop ID: 2889983340Mod ID: LastMinutePrepperMod ID: LastMinutePrepperReloadedMap Folder: LastMinutePrepperMap Folder: LastMinutePrepperReloaded</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125338860' target='_blank'>Canvasback Studios (ID: 3125338860)</a><p>Welcome to Canvasback studios, where your dreams can take flight!Our secluded, state of the art facilities feature everything required to tackle all scales of projects.

Tall apartment buildings and wealthy suburbs await you, however be wary of its narrow alleyways and even narrower staircases, death will await you at every turn so be cautious with every step you take.Pas mal non ? C'est français.Cell occupied (15,22)This map conflicts with Wildberries, pick one of the two.Some answers to frequently asked questions:- (As of 03/05/24) Despite the many comments, this map works in multiplayer like any other up to date map and is set up like any other map, 100% of issues with Chestown not working in multiplayer are user side and not the fault of the mod itself, as evidenced by the 10s of thousands of people using it in multiplayer.- Has a police station, multiple medical POIs, a pawn shop, a hardware store and a library, doesn't have a school, fire station, gun store or warehouses. The map will never be made bigger and will never have new buildings (school, bigger suburbs, etc.). Willmaybehave basements once B42 comes out.- Loot and vehicle zones all work fine and as expected, meaning that loot does spawn (and respawns according to your sandbox settings) as do cars.- Zombie density is tied to the size/height of a building and mappers cannot change that, meaning that despite its small size, Chestown will always have a ton of zombies because of its many tall and dense buildings.- Loot density: Same thing, tall and dense buildings mean lots of rooms to explore and lots of loot to get, if you think that's game breaking you should not play with this map.- Too many guns: I don't know what causes this for some people. My playtests were fine. Sometimes it's added mods that mess up loot tables, sometimes it's the game itself that spawns too many guns in rooms that are connected to one another if one room is supposed to have a higher chance of spawning guns than others. If that's the case I can't do anything about it. I suspect it is more obvious in Chestown than in the vanilla map (or other modded maps) since a lot of buildings are connected to each other.I will leave the older comments but going forward I will be deleting any new comments about these specific topics I just covered.This map is considered finished and will not be updated further (save gamebreaking updates).

The local Cannery, was opened shortly after in 1821 by the town's first Mayor, Harrison Harrington.Over the decades, the town continued to grow and become more self sufficient, attracting in many different professionals and businesses.By the late 1980's the interest of most residents of Greenport had moved on from fishing due to the growing prosperity of the town, resulting in the Cannery scaling back production.  Seeing the changes in the town, the Mayor believed promoting the town's growing local business scene would help draw in the tourists and bolster the coffers of Greenport.  His plans included renovating parts of the large Cannery into a Tourism center, granting local artisans vending liceses to operate out of the historic town square and the construction of a community swimming pool and open air gym adjacent to the square.Amenities in Greenport include: multiple fishing piers, gas station and mechanic shop, doctor's office, hunting and camping store, K-12 school, daycare, church and cemetary, bank, post office, book store, coffee shop, sewing store, barber shop, grocery and tool store, police station, bar as well as a beach and Fish n' Chip restaurant.A BIG thank you to SlenderGreen for her huge help in making this map become a reality.

It was initially modified shortly before the zombie outbreak of 1993, with the aim of hosting the upper classes of Louisville, in an epidemic that the governments already saw coming.

(Customized by professions)-Car spawn in the city-Some secret buildings that do not appear on the map to be discovered-It is fully compatible with the "Trimble County Power Station & La Grange" map, and it is recommended to play it with it.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2802755864IMPORTANT:-If you have already visited the area, you will need to restart the game, or wipe the server for it to appear.-All required mods are mandatory, without them many map tiles will be missing-The mod has two versions, the original without zombies in the city, and one with normal population. If you want to put the one with zombie population you must choose that version in mods in the main screen, or use the second ID of the mod (for servers).Thanks to:AtoxWarrior:  For his great tutorials on how to start mapping.SnakeModding: For helping me with specific doubts about the Ingame map and others.PZ Community: (Especially to Dylan, Daddie Dirkie, throttlekitty, and fantasized for their tiles) For some buildings and occasional help.Enjoy the map!Any report or bug leave me in the comments ^^Workshop ID: 2817859141Mod ID: hopewell_eng_origMod ID: hopewell_eng_zombiesMap Folder: Hopewell, KY</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018062764' target='_blank'>Hunter's Base (ID: 3018062764)</a><p>Hunter's BaseIn the deep forests of Riverside lived a seasoned old hunter.

I feel like the map does a decent job of filling in some dead space between Riverside & West Point.This is our first map & as such it only uses the vanilla tiles (aside from the awesome sign). The map may have some errors, feel free to comment and I'll do my best to fix anything. You may also feel that the loot is too heavy or light as I built a majority of the buildings as I went, so feel free to voice any bugs/loot/etc issues as well. Expect semi-frequent updates early on as I finish refining & polishing the map after some play-testing.Compatibility:So far, the only map I've found that Rabbit Hash conflicts with is North Peak. The cell is included in that map, but isn't used. Simply load Rabbit Hash before North Peak and both maps should work fine.Like the map?

READ ALL BEFORE DOWNLOAD!BY SUBSCRIBING TO THIS MOD, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE FULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION, AND YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH IT.FOR VERSION 41.71What you need to know:After EACH update for avoid bugs, you MUST start a new game. Sad but true.You need to turn this option OFF in sandbox (Randomized house chance - set never)Turn ON in the game settings (Double-sized textures: Yes)There are three zones of various difficulty on the map. They have a different spawn number of infected, and other features. This map may be too hard for some people, it is not designed for beginners. Some spawn points can be very difficult, others easy. It depends on your luck. Sometimes you may appear surrounded by zombies.Still do not forget that you personally adjust the difficulty of the game in the sandbox, if it seems to you that the map is too hard or easy, then change your own settings.This mod does NOT conflicts with Fort Redstone. But mod conflicts with the All-In Zomboid Map Pack (AIZ), New Denver (Slocan Lake) and every other map mod that replaces the same game cells (see last screenshot).There is a lot of loot on the map. The map was created to gain a different experience from vanilla, where there will be more action, and where there will be a lot of everything - from infected to weapons. The city was planned for fast raids with friends (or solo), and not to establish a base here.How do I get in from the standard map?Straight west from Rosewood(upper left corner on the PZ map) until you see a road sign indicating the city.You will need a sledgehammer to get out of townUnfortunately, the text in the description is limited, click on the link below to read the description in full.

В них разное кол-во зомби и другие особенности. Эта карта может оказаться слишком сложной для некоторых людей, она не предназначена для новичков. Некоторые точки спавна могут быть очень сложными, другие - легкими. Это зависит от вашей удачи. Иногда вы можете оказаться в окружении зомби.Тем не менее, не забывайте что сложность игры вы лично настраиваете в песочнице, если вам кажется что карта слишком сложная или простая, значит измените свои настройки.Этот мод НЕ конфликтует с Fort Redstone. Но мод конфликтует с All-In Zomboid Map Pack, New Denver и всеми остальными модификациями карт, которые заменяют те же игровые ячейки (см. Последний снимок экрана).На карте много лута. Карта создана для получения иного типа опыта, где будет больше действий и изобилие всего - от зомби до оружия. Город был спланирован для быстрых рейдов с друзьями (или в одиночку), а не для создания здесь базы.Как попасть в город со стандартной карты?Идите прямо на запад от Роузвуда (верхний левый угол на карте PZ), пока не увидите дорожный знак, указывающий на город.Вам нужна кувалда чтобы покинуть городК сожалению, текст в описании ограничен лимитом, нажмите на ссылку ниже, чтобы прочитать описание полностью.

It's design is inspired by the sprawling complex of Black Mesa from the Half-Life series, as well as from the town of Eureka from the TV show Eureka (2006).The facility conducts advanced research in the areas of high tech aerospace engineering, plant sciences and advanced biomedical research. The facility contains a several large research facilities, a satellite launch facility, a small heliport, a military outpost and a company town to house the employees of the facility.GameplayThe entire facility is surrounded by double wide, unclimbable military grade fence, and at the time of gamestart the facility has been placed on a full lockdown. This means it will be impossible to get past the main gate with a car until youhave a sledgehammer(you can still climb the front gate). The zombie population are very high within the facility, but there are many valuable looting areas and many army vehicle spawns making it a much more attractive late-game looting spot compared to its vanilla counterpart."The Biomedical & Engineering Facilities are on full lockdown with shutters blocking off all entrance and exits, if the system worked the infection will be contained" (hint: there are ways in/out without a sledge)You can spawn within the base, but the spawns are VERY high so it will be a very tough start in terms of numbers if playing on normal or above.An optional addon is included that connects the Research Facility to Rosewood via a proper main road (see worldmap image for cells)CompatabilityThe map uses the cells 18,41 / 18,42 & 19,41 / 19,42.Works well with...Fort Redstone 2.0- This mod was specifically designed to support the new incarnation of Fort Redstone, and does not overlap any of its cells at time of writing.Raven Creek-LOAD Raven Creek AFTER THIS MOD!Tested with this mod and works fine (they come up right against each other but dont overlap)Incompatible with...Slocan Lake (Sort of works, you must put Slocan Lake (and Raven Creek etc) AFTER Research Facility.Rosewood Access Road (breaks half the map) and is not needed (This map contains its own access road).Multiplayer / ServerMake sure you go into the server settings, map, and then add this map to the list and move it up to the top of the list to ensure it prioritizes generating the new area rather than the base map (not sure why its an issue within this map).Special ThanksDaddyDirk for his tile mod, and his excellent YouTube series that taught me how to map!Support Updates and More ContentLike the map and want to see more?

With the upcoming B42 announced to be this year, including all the changes to heights (negative Z levels especially) I have decided to leave off doing any major reworks/updates until that comes out.

The idea was to start the game in a difficult situation but not so suffocating like "A Really CD DA" Challenge. I tried to give as much "life" as possible in the buildings to make sure it doesn't look so much blend as the vanilla ones, also secrets can be found in some them.Some buildings may be burnt or barricaded with lots of loot in it, but it's not my doing, the game randomly mark some buildings to spawn this way.In the spawn point you start in a cage and most of the time it is locked (as it should be) so I recommend the "Better Lockpicking" Mod and spawn-cheat some bobbypin's and a screwdrive into your inventory, also the "Lockpicking magazine" if you didn't take the "locksmith" trait of course.I also recommend the mod "Real Ladder" If you want to climb some roofs._____Help me[ko-fi.com]_____Workshop ID: 2857335271Mod ID: TheEyeLakeMap Folder: TheEyeLake</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2991291149' target='_blank'>The Frigate (ID: 2991291149)</a><p>Under the cover of night, the USS Volfram Amorosa docked along the Ohio River.

There isn't anything I can do about how the other map authors treat their roads. So for now, you'll want to move/destroy those road blocks on the edge of Coryerdon, and clear out some trees and maybe even lay concrete down on the edge of Over the River. If you choose Dirkerdam instead of Coryerdon, it's a clean seamless connection.I chose not to overwrite the adjoining cell of Over the River or Coryerdon as this would require a specific map load order to line everything up, and that would surely cause confusion, not to mention I didn't feel comfortable with overlaying my work onto someone else's.Huge ass thanks to Daddy Dirkie Dirk...his videos were absolutely critical in learning how to pull all this off, thanks dude.

The Club member is obliged to strictly follow the rules of this instruction. Violation of the rules can lead to serious injury or even death.INITIAL BRIEFINGBefore your journey:1. Check that you have personal flotation devices (swimming trunks, goggles, diving mask, lifebuoy).2. Before going out to sea, assess the strength and direction of the wind (use a compass).3. Stock up on food, fresh water and medicines. If you are planning to get to the boat by swimming, then you should not take too many heavy things with you, because you can lose them. Don't try to swim with a crowbar in your hands!4. To lower the boat from the trailer, use the winch (key "V").5. To get to the boat, take a running jump in water (WASD + Shift + Space). But be careful, head diving is not recommended.6. Climb aboard the boats using a specially organized ladder, holding onto the railing.After boarding:1. Familiarize yourself with the evacuation plan (key "Z").2. Carry out a technical inspection of the yacht. Check the fuel level in the gas tank, the condition of the battery, and on the sailing yacht the condition of the sails.3. In case the cabin is closed, you need to use a key or other less legal tools to open the lock.4. Before leaving, check if the hatches are closed, if things are fixed in the saloon, in the galley, in the cabins, check that all lockers are latched, the toilet seat cover is lowered and the valves are closed. Don't forget to raise the anchor.While traveling:1. Do not throw any items overboard, even if you really want to do it (by right mouse clicking on an item in your inventory). The Club is not responsible for things lost in this way.2. In the case of a galley (kitchen), be careful when using electrical appliances.3. When changing the position of the sail (keys "Left arrow" and "Right arrow"), watch the ropes - sheets, mooring lines, anchor rope. If they find themselves overboard, wind up on the propeller, the yacht will be immobilized. Catch your foot - you fly overboard. Put your foot in the loop of the anchor rope - you will go to the bottom with the anchor.4. The devices installed on the sailing boat will tell you the direction and strength of the wind, as well as give you a hint on which side to set the sail (focus on the color).5. Do not swim in drift (not at anchor). The yacht is drifting at a speed of one or two knots - don't catch up by swimming!6. When leaving and mooring, all free team members must be vigilant and ready to act according to the situation.7. In the event of a malfunction that cannot be eliminated on your own, send a request for service tothe administration of the Club.End of briefing.By joining our Club you confirm that you have all the necessary skills to control motor and sailing yachts. If you have any questions about boat management, ask them in the comments. More experienced members of the Club will answer your questions.Worked on the mod:iBrRus - lua code, scripts, motor yacht interfacesAiteron - lua code, scriptsKukrapok - 3D models, environment sounds, sailing yacht interfacesTroy Mc'Clure - 3d modelsDavid Ree - MusicYou can freely use this mod on your server.

Each flag comes in two sizes, large (three tiles wide) and small (one tile wide, hanging vertically). The flags have all been painstakingly designed to look like the game's original flags.Multiplayer server admins can spawn the flags using the names provided in the screenshots. As a point of note, all flags in this pack begin with the prefix "ENF" (ExtraNoise's Flags) followed by the flag name. Small flags include the suffix "Small". These are great for adding character to servers whose players might want to establish boundaries for their faction or other player representation.Included FlagsIncluded in this pack are: National flags (unfortunately not all nations are included, but it is a vast majority), European regional flags, Canadian provincial flags, US state flags, historical flags, independence movement flags, fictional flags from media, US national and international organization flags, various protest flags, pride flags, a collection random flags and banners, some handwritten "flags" using bedsheets for flavor and base labeling, and a selection of flags that are my favorites from reddit's r/vexillology subreddit.Now Craftable!I appreciate everyone's patience as I worked diligently to make each of the flags in the pack craftable--at almost 50,000 lines of code!--so that players can now make them in the game without having to rely on multiplayer server admins to spawn them in (helpful if you are not playing a multiplayer server, as you can imagine). In order to make them, you will need to first craft a blank flag usingsheets, scissors, a needle or sewing kit, and thread. Once a blank flag has been crafted, you will needa paintbrush and paint bucketsto paint the flag. It's not an elegant solution, but it is designed to keep your context menus simple instead of trying to list out 500 options when you accidentally right-click a sheet in your inventory.A warning:Paint cans are heavy! I've updated the recipes so that flags can be crafted from paint cans on floors or shelves. You can also have the paint cans on you, but being overloaded can cause injury.Good luck and don't say I didn't warn you.Regular PlayersYou need to subscribe to this mod if you've downloaded a map that makes use of the tiles in this pack or a multiplayer server has been configured to use them. You don't have to enable the crafting sub-mod included unless you want to use it or the multiplayer server you're on uses it.Map MakersYou can download the raw tiles (with instructions on how to use them) here:https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6c9q4xu6gjz4zt/en_flags.zip?dl=0A Note on DiscretionFlags are one of those things that are often considered benign and inoffensive... until they aren't. Included in this pack are a number of flags that have a sordid history. For example, even the United States flag could fall into this category for some people. That being said, where contentions arise I have chosen to use the current flag for any given nation/region instead of the 1993 version (which some flags use) based on the in-game start date. A good example of this is the inclusion of the 2021 Mississippi flag instead of its predecessor. This is purely up to my own choice and may be changed in future releases of this pack. I have chosen to omit a number of incredibly divisive or incendiary flags, such as those used by hate groups in the modern day. I will absolutely not entertain the idea of including these flags in future releases, so please do not ask.Anyone is free to modify the content of this pack as they need for their map/server.Take a look at my other mods!Where I hang out & post updates[discord.gg]Workshop ID: 2784607980Mod ID: EN_FlagsMod ID: EN_Flags_Craft</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2774834715' target='_blank'>ExtraNoise's Newburbs Tiles (ID: 2774834715)</a><p>Standardized suburban development exploded in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s and continues to this day.

Not to mention the 37-inch trail tires and removable hardtop (and doors). The new Bronco was specifically designed to take what makes the Jeep Wrangler so good and do it better.Did they succeed? I'll let you be the judge as you bypass those pesky streets full of zombs to take the scenic route (which, honestly, is probably also full of zombs) as you enjoy the top down with the wind and blood in your hair.The version released here is the four-door 2021 Ford Bronco Wildtrak edition with Sasquatch package. Quite the mouthful, but what it boils down to is "the good version" with "the big ol' tires."AboutThe hard top is assigned to the "rear windshield" and can be taken off by removing the rear windshield using the vehicle mechanics menu. It requires a wrench and just a single mechanics skill to replicate the fact that it's fairly easy to do in real life. The doors can be similarly removed.This vehicle is not lore-friendly! The game takes place in 1993 and this vehicle is from 2021.It is my tenth vehicle and was made as fun thank you to my Patreon patrons for supporting me through ten releases. I was originally planning to release it just to them, but they urged me to release it everyone and they eventually convinced me. This is the first in what will probably be a limited run of anachronistic vehicles I release every time I hit 10 vehicles.Seven Color Options:Replicating the colors the vehicle was offered in.Animated:Opening doors, windows, hood, and tailgate.Mechanic System:Removable/repairable parts and custom profile graphic.Usable spare tire.Physics:Realistic handling and properties with an off-road focus.Distribution:Found in middle class and upper class areas and sometimes in parking lots.Wreck Included:A burned wreck version can be found to add some new variety to major backups.Youtube ReviewsEmberDragonGames [2:40]Future PlansThe spare tire on the back is fixed in place whether it is "there" or not as it is part of the tailgate mesh. I was not able to find a good solution, as it either the spare tire appeared but clipped the opening tailgate or failed to appear at all. I will update this mod once I find a solution.EthosMy goal is to release cars that fit naturally into the game world and stylistically match the base-game's textures and art design. Additionally, I've also strive for my work to be ultra light-weight (to keep performance smooth) and to look great with other vehicle mods that share a similar ethos, such as Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars, fhqwhgads' Motorious Zone, and improvement mods such as the Vanilla Vehicle Enhancer, among others.My vehicle mods use real world names.My other vehiclesCheck out the ExtraNoises's Automobile Extravaganza vehicle pack for all of my lore-friendly vehicles!And please, if you like my work:Workshop ID: 3022284904Mod ID: en21_Bronco</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029146724' target='_blank'>1972 AMC Javelin (Unsupported) (ID: 3029146724)</a><p>Attention: This mod is now obsolete and has been deprecated!

If not, just download it.What the vanilla game does that causes this problemThe game wants to show you a tooltip of the top 10 items that are valid for a given recipe, so it:1. Builds a complete list of all valid items, in no particular order.2. Sorts this complete list to move all items you actually have to the top -O(n)complexity.3. Removes any items that are considered duplicates by virtue of being applicable to different slots (e.g. Left/right handed wristwatch) -O(n^2)complexity!4. Renders the top 10 items of the list, ignoring anything else.This is wasteful because it processes the full list of items, even though we only care about the top 10.What this mod makes it do1. We build a complete list of valid items, but any items that exist in your inventory are sent to the start of the list,at the point of insertion.2. The list is truncated to the first 10 items and only these are sorted. We store the original length of the list for later -O(1)complexity.3. Deduplication occurs as in vanilla, but, again, the list is now only 10 items long -O(1)complexity.4. We render the list again. If there were more than 10 items, we ensure that the "and X more" text is computed correctly from the pre-truncation list size.Workshop ID: 2915430406Mod ID: FixTooltipLag</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2769706949' target='_blank'>Tidy Up Meister (ID: 2769706949)</a><p>Overview :Automatically returns to the original equipment when the operation is completed.Confirmed to work with Build 41.78.Features :When an action that switches equipment when performed, such as dismantle, is completed, the equipment is automatically restored to its original state.When automatically returning equipment, if the equipment was in a container, it will be returned to original container.You can toggle whether or not to re-equipment from the context menu.

It has tons of recipes but it wont let you craft EVERY metal object there is in the game. It is meant to be a profession suitable for a self learned apocalypse survivor or a former blacksmith - not for a superhero who can magically craft complex machinery after reading a magazine.Works in SP and MP and can be added to existing savegames.New items:Stone furnace, bellows, anvil, forging mold, charcoal pit, metal cutter, hand drill and grindstone. + Two recipe books.Recipe details:Most metal items can be melted using a furnace or a blowtorch.The other half can be stomped with any hammer-like object.You can also mine various ores with my :Dynamic Miningmod.Both - melting and stomping- will create unusable metal that is melted into iron ingots.Most car parts and metal furniture can be melted into unusable metal as well (Furnace or blowtorch).All gold/silver can be melted into nuggets and uses along with metal to create welding rods.From iron ingots you can forge tons of tools, materials and even engine parts, using - molds, metal cutters, hand drills, knives, hammers, grindstones etc.Mold is drainable and needs to be refilled with dirt time to time.Charcoal is made in a charcoal pit by slow burning wood for couple of days.All recipes can be created from ground so you can have materials/items nearby and not in your hand. Just in case be sure you keep your other stuff you don't want to be melted further away from the metal works area.Furnace and charcoal pit is built on the spot and cant be moved without destroying it first. Anvil and Grindstone can be moved but are heavy. Destroying a furnace will give you most of the stuff back.Metal antique oven and BBQ can also be craft-forged.Blowtorch uses both petrol and propane.Dismantle railroad tracks, big metal structures and various industrial equipment into metal.Small chance to get hurt(scratched) when doing metalwork.Everything related to metalworking needs a certain skill + a recipe book. Metalworker profession starts with some free recipes already given to them.This is part of... :Project Realistic Overhaul- Set of mods I've created that will overhaul the vanilla game experience to be more hardcore and true to life, but on the other hand leaves you the option to make it through and survive. It makes items and actions have more value and makes the world more alive.Credits :Special thanks toSumYungGuyfor testing this mod and toDmitriySenpaifor providing the translation template!

Containers that can be worn on your back get 2 slots. all other containers get 1.At level 10 tailoring, you can add an additional upgrade to any bag.To add an upgrade you will need the upgrade item you want to add, a sewing needle, and at least 1 unit of thread.To remove upgrades you will need a pair of scissors.Upgraded bags retain their upgrades until the item is destroyed or the upgrade is removed. This means you can add an additional upgrade to other people's bags.Obtaining/Crafting Upgrade ItemsAll upgrade items can be looted in the world, and all but the best ones can be crafted.The stats for each upgrade and spawn rates for each tier of item can be changed in the Sandbox settings.These stats are always displayed as part of the Upgrade Items tooltip and changes dynamically based on the sandbox settings of the world.Military upgrades cannot be crafted, but you can convert Military upgrades into their opposite type if you have level 10 tailoring. (Meaning you can turn a Military Capacity upgrade into a Military Weight Reduction upgrade)Capacity UpgradesBag capacity upgrades have 2 components to them. Flat Bonuses and Multipliers.The Bonus will add a flat amount of capacity regardless of what kind of bag its attached to.The Multiplier will add a percentage bonus to the bags existing size, rounding to the nearest whole number.Example; a 10% bonus for the duffel bag would increase its capacity from 18 to 20. the bonus from the multiplier is +1.8, rounded up to to a +2.Formula; Capacity = (BaseCapacity*(1+MultiplierBonus))+FlatBonusContainer Capacity is still affected by the Organized and Disoragnized traits. This leads to some pretty insane bag capacities with modded backpacks. (Brita's)Default values for Capacity upgrades;TypeMultiplierBonusCrafting RequirementsCloth+10%+1Tailoring 3Denim+20%+1Tailoring 5Leather+25%+2Tailoring 7Military+35%+2Loot OnlyWeight Reduction UpgradesWeight reduction upgrades only have 1 component, their Weight Reduction Efficiency bonus.This value is not a flat bonus to the weight reduction of an item, and the math is fairly complicated compared to the capacity bonus.The efficiency increase is a bonus based on the missing weight reduction between its current value and 100%.Simply put, increasing a bags weight reduction efficiency by 50% will cause the items in the bag to weigh half as much as they did before. Increasing the efficiency by 25% will make the items in the bag weigh 25% less than they did before. and so on.Example 1: the Big Hiking Bag has an 80% weight reduction value. giving it a 50% bonus adds an even 10% bonus (20*0.5) bringing it up to a 90% reduction.Example 2: the Duffel bag has a 65% weight reduction, giving it a 35% bonus results in a bonus of 12.25, rounded to 12% totaling a 77% reductionExample 3: the Military Backpack has a 87% weight reduction, giving it a 20% bonus would add  2.6 (13*0.2), rounded up to 3%, totaling 90%Formula; Weight Reduction = 100-( (100-BaseWR)*TotalEfficiencyBonus )TypeEffiencyBonusCrafting RequirementsCloth+15%Tailoring 3Denim+25%Tailoring 5Leather+35%Tailoring 7Military+50%Loot OnlyIs this mod compatible with Inventory Tetris?Yes and no, I've never used inventory tetris so i don't know how it works. I've been told in the vanilla game it segments the bags into various compartments. and that does break with modified inventory size values. turning it into quote "one big box" but otherwise I've been told it does work functionally.I can't pick up my backpack / My backpack is stuck in a containerYeah.. this is an issue caused by the 50 weight hard limit on every character. The game will not let you pick up an item that would put your character's total weight over 50, regardless of strength or modified carry weight values. (pack mule)Weight reduction doesn't apply until you have the bag equipped, and since you have to pick up the bag before you can equip it, there's a period of time where you have to be able to carry the full weight of the backpack. for most normal bags this isn't an issue.But, when dealing with upgraded or modded bags, its possible to fill a bag so much that picking it up would put you over that 50 weight hard limit, which prevents you from picking it up.Since the bag is probably equipped when you fill it, its actual weight wont be applied to the character immediately. But if you drop the bag or put it in a container. it now weights the full weight which can prevent you from picking it back up.To fix the problem, move the bag to the floor directly if its not already there. Once the bag is on the floor you can access its inventory like any other container and take some stuff out to reduce the weight, then you can pick up the bag properly, put it on, and then put the stuff back into the bag from the floor. Its an awkward fix, but there's no way to fix it without pseudo-permanently changing the weight of items manually, which could cause tons of other issues.Is this mod compatible with XYZ?You can answer this question yourself pretty easily,If the mod in question changes existing items WITHOUT crafting them using zomboid's normal crafting menu. then it may have a conflict. Even if it does, the conflict should not break either mod.If the mod adds new items or uses the crafting system to upgrade them, then it should be fully compatible. save for the possiblity of accidentally deleting your upgrades.Crafting Upgraded Items WarningWhen you upgrade an item with this mod, that upgrade info is saved as part of the items Mod Data. If you use the upgraded item to craft another item, it will be deleted and the upgrades will be lost.This isn't too likely, as very few mods use backpacks as crafting ingredients, but it's worth a warning anyway.Known IssuesSome minor text clipping issues with pretty much any other mod that adds custom Tooltips.Sometimes items have their stats reset, Upgraded items will not automatically fix their stats by default. This was done to hopefully avoid conflicts with other mods that change item stats. If an item has unexpected stats then an option to Fix Upgrades will appear in the context menu for that item.Translations;Traditional Chinese ( CH ) by Roc TsengRussian ( RU ) by Fleshka and ArikahikaSimplified Chinese ( CN ) by LotharioSunGerman ( DE ) by KandloSpanish ( ES ) by Pela667I'm usually pretty active on my workshop pages comment sections but i also have a discord.If you'd like to help translate one of my mods or just need help sorting something out feel free to join the discord and message me.https://discord.gg/FgvW5vDyYVWorkshop ID: 2996978365Mod ID: LazoloDynamicBackpackUpgrades</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717575749' target='_blank'>Faction Safehouses With Friends (ID: 2717575749)</a><p>This creates a way for multiple people to create a safehouse, then create a faction and this mod will take these members and add eachother to eachothers safehouses every in-game hour.

So if you don't like this,I recommend changing sandbox options. (Check 'Adjust Base Damage' & 'Base Damage Multiplier' options)#In default setting, when the aiming level is low, the aiming speed is quite slow and the recoil is enormous, so it may be difficult to use firearms. Modifying the sandbox options is fine, but I give a little weight to attachments' options for increasing the value of attachments.So when the aiming level is low, I recommend actively using the attachments like muzzle brake or grips that reduce recoil or scopes that reduce aiming time.Recommended Mods--------------------------------------------------------------------------------True Crouching,True Crawl- Can shoot with reduced recoil while crouching / crawling!Workshop ID: 2971847072Mod ID: ImprovedProjectileMod ID: ImprovedProjectileAddonMod ID: ImprovedProjectileVanillaMod ID: ImprovedProjectileZ</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2578003871' target='_blank'>Satchel With Bags (ID: 2578003871)</a><p>Simple mod letting you wear satchels with backpacks.Now updated to allow your satchels to show over jackets, vests, and more!Includes new ItemTweaker version for maximum compatibility!ItemTweaker version requiresItemTweakerAPI B41 by TchernobillorItemTweakerAPI by DarkSlayerEXHuge thanks to Fernzi for help debugging!SUGGESTED MODS:More Satchel Weight ReductionSleep On ItBuilt and tested for version 41.53+Tested and working for singleplayer 41.60Workshop ID: 2578003871Mod ID: satchelwithbagsMod ID: satchelwithbagsIT</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2671262103' target='_blank'>25% Wood Weight (ID: 2671262103)</a><p>25% Wood WeightReduce weight of planks, logs and a few related items to 25% of their original weight.Affected items:2 Logs Stack:         6   -> 1.5

The vehicles are vanilla-styled (including lore-friendly names, or optional real names), era appropriate (1993 and earlier), and support all the features of vanilla vehicles. The pack will be a variety pack, aiming to add a little bit of everything to the game from everyday sedans, vans and SUVs to sports cars, with sports cars being much more rare than everyday machines.All cars that are capable of it also supportPaint Your Ride!Note: This mod will update onWednesdaysIt may not be every Wednesday, but if something is ready for release, that's when I'll updateIf you were using my existing standalone vehicle mods, it issafe (and best)to switch to this mod.This mod contains the following vehicle mods of mine: Lancia Stratos, R32 Skyline, Supra, Fox Body, Kei Sports, LM002, 240SX Coupe, Diablo, 300ZX, GT40, Miata, Toyota X90s, and Reliant Robin Mk. II. Disable these mods and use this instead if you plan on using this mod, as they can cause issues when used together.You can choose which cars you would like to spawn naturally, from 3 selections of car listsIf you want all cars to spawn, you don't need to enable the optional Spawn Selection sub-modsTo choose which types of cars you'd like to have spawn, enable the Spawn Selection sub-mods of the cars you would like to allow to spawn in addition to the main mod. There are 3 lists to choose from, and you can select any combination of them:US Motors:This list contains cars that were available and sold in the US. Examples include the Bronco, Mustang, and 240SX.Imports:This list contains cars that were not available and sold in the US, but common in other countries. Examples are the R32 Skyline, Toyota Mark II, and Reliant RobinRares and Exotics:This list contains cars that are either very expensive or produced in very low numbers. Examples are the GT40, Diablo, and Stratos.Also note that the imports and exotics are both very rare in the base spawn lists, and the Spawn Selection sub-mods will not make them more common.What's new in the pack?The newest addition is the AMG Mercedes-Benz 600SEL. This particular model has parts made by AMG before they officially became a part of Mercedes. New ID: fhqV140_600SEL_AMGAdditionally, the mod has been translated to German thanks to Eaglefire. Check out their German Project Zomboid communityhere![discord.gg]This mod pairs well withVehicle Spawn Zones Expanded.Since the exotic and import cars are very rare, I started work on the spawn zones to give some specified areas for these cars to spawn, so there is a decent chance to find them on a save without it potentially becoming overwhelming. It eventually became more, adding a variety of new spawn areas beyond that. It works very well with this mod, and has many spawn lists for cars in this pack.Also check out these complimentary MZ-themed mods!FAQQ: Multiplayer compatible?A:Yes!In general, all of my (and many of others') vehicles will be MP compatible unless stated otherwise.Q: Can this be used with other vehicle mods?A:Yes!It will work with other vehicle packs, and standalone vehicle mods. This mod was even made with use alongside mods like Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars in mind, and has its spawn chances based around it. It doesn't alter anything vanilla either, so anything that changes vanilla vehicles will also work!Q: What are the vehicle IDs?A: I've set up a post in the discussions with each vehicle ID and some small information about each car, check it out if you need the IDs.Q: How rare are the exotic/import cars?A: They areveryrare, exotics in particular will be difficult to find on default (low) and normal car spawn rates. Exotics and imports will mostly only spawn near high-end houses, or anywhere else you can find the Cossette and Lang 4000 in vanilla, at a lower spawn rate. Some Easter Egg cars will spawn in similar areas to the Easter Egg cars from Used Cars. For some more specific hints,Riverside has a very large amount of possible spawn zones, and the bar across from the junkyard contains only sports car spawns, so that is the best place to look.Q: Can this be added mid-save?A:Yes!Vehicles will only spawn in areas you have not explored yet however, so if you or your server have been all over the map, you may have trouble finding the vehicles. I'd recommend usingUdderly Vehicle Respawnif you want to use this on an existing save, it will allow new vehicles to spawn in explored areas the world.Q: I'm having issues joining/starting a server in MP (File mismatch, or connection lost after starting)A: First, check AuthenticPeach's guide about these issueshere.[theindiestone.com]For more info, check the first post of the "Bug reports" thread in discussions.Q: Can you make (x)?A: If you're going to request a car, note that my main focus at the moment are cars that fit the game's time period (1993 and earlier). I do have cars outside of this timeframe on my list, but it may be a while before I get to them. I also already have quite a few on my list, so there's no guarantee I'll get to all of them.Q: What about animations?A: Animations are planned to officially come to vanilla vehicles, so they are planned for this pack as well. While I will redo some cars before TIS' animations are officially available, they will be released as separate mods for the time being with options to replace the ones in the pack, due to some features not working with animated parts. I'm still going to add vehicles in the current vanilla style to the pack, better set up for the upcoming animations.Workshop ID: 2791656602Mod ID: fhqMotoriusZoneMod ID: fhqMotoriusZoneImportsMod ID: fhqMotoriusZoneExoticsMod ID: fhqMotoriusZoneRealNamesMod ID: fhqMotoriusZoneUSDM</p></li><li><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640569820' target='_blank'>AutoCook (ID: 2640569820)</a><p>So you are here ?Ah.. you're bored of spending your life preparing your next meal.You've come to the right place.How to initiate the food preparation ?You need an empty Bowl, Frying Pan or Griddle Pan.You need accessible food.See your Character Info Panel 'Cook' tab for more options.Right click on the Bowl / Pan in your inventory and left click on "Auto Cook XXX"LimitationsWorks only on evolved recipes, not on simple recipes.Requires empty container (cannot continue from manually started preparation).CreditsVersion 1.7-1.8 Community propositions implemented byMassCraxx.That's it.Why are you still here ?What ?

You can salvage all vehicles except Wrecks*.This option will completely salvage and remove the vehicle clearing the path.Depending on your Metal Working skill, you will salvage the vehicle faster and receive many useful items the higher your skill.I do recommend removing as many parts of the vehicle as you can and empty the vehicle before salvage of the vehicle body. This will give you vehicle parts to use, further salvage options for those parts and your character will have gained more knowledge about vehicles and gained more skill XP in Mechanics and Metal Working.The Vanilla option for *dismantle wreck option is also still available (only for wrecked vehicles), takes less time but your returns are smaller and less varied with less XP too.The better you are at Mechanics or Metal Welding will mean your talents will produce better results from the Salvage!A Mechanic knows the parts he wants, gaining skills in Metal Welding means he can better acquire those parts.Suggested workshop items that add to the experienceMany Vehicle mods on the workshop are already supported with this mod !The list below are some of my favsKI5's VehiclesCyt VehiclesSharks VehiclesTread's Water Tank TrucksCrashed CarsCraft Helper ContinuedViperels Vehicle Spare PartsCompatibilityGood with everything!!

Maps read before enabling this Mod will be displayed as not read.You may add it to your mod pack without confirmation and credit. However, please use at your own risk, as I have not been able to verify that it works with SP.Since v1.1, the implementation is very dependent on vanilla code. Therefore, I hope that the function of this Mod will be implemented on the vanilla side in the future.If you were unable to log in to the MP server due to an upgrade of this mod, please try the previous versions by downloading them from "Change Notes".Release Notes :v2.10 - Added Auto Marking (Optional).v2.9 - Supported Maps.v2.8 - Added Translation (Czech (CS) and Italiano (IT)).v2.7 - Added Translation (Turkish (TR)).
