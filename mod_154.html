Hi Survivors!
I've created this new version of Fort Knox to allow players to use
this map alongside Eerie County since they were in the same spot,
south of Muldraugh.
Following the road southwest of Fort Knox, you'll reach Eren City, a location in Eerie Country.
It also has a road up north, that connects Fort Knox to Bedford Falls.
You can simply disable Bedford Falls, or Eerie Country if you don't want to
play on one of those two maps.
If you want to play with "Bedford Falls" map too,
remember to activate the mod "Road between Fort Knox and Bedford Falls"

The original version of
Fort Knox is here:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1414568604
Both this and that version are compatible with Build40 and 41
WARNING!! You CAN'T use "eris_minimap_fort_knox_plugin"
with this version of Fort Knox, because the position of the cells is different.
This map doesn't conflict either, with the following maps:
- Phoenix; Beta 1.4 "Final Flaw" either.
- South Muldraugh
Let me know if there is any other map in this spot.
