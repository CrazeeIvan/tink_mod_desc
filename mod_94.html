This addon for
Mod Manager
and
Mod Manager: Server
makes it much easier to activate mods from a Steam collection.
Now you donâ€™t need to constantly Alt-Tab, copy the name of the mod and search for it in the mod list, repeating this a couple of hundred times.
How to use
Install and activate
Mod Manager
or
Mod Manager: Server
. If you use Mod Manager: Server, place it before the addon in the mod load order.
Make sure your Steam collection is Public or Unlisted.
Click on the "From collection" button in the Mod Manager.
If you're not subcribed to all of the mods from the collection, enable the "Skip unsubscribed mods" option.
If you want to keep current active mods, disable the "Disable current active mods" option.
Paste your Steam collection link and click "OK". If your collection has many items, be patient, don't click or press anything. Mods from collection will be activated automatically.
If there are some workshop items that have more than one mod, you'll be asked to manually activate the mods you need from a separate list of mods, which is divided into categories with workshop item names.
Note
If you subscribe to mods from collection while in Zomboid, you'll need to restart the game to refresh mod list.
Compatibility
Compatible with
Mod Manager: Enhanced Load Order
and any other mods.
