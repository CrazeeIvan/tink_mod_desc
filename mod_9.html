WARNING: THIS MOD REQUIRES JAVA MODDING (check instructions below)
Your body is a temple. However, if you don't care for it properly it could have dire consequences.
Sadly, the base game doesn't reflect your condition, and this mod fixes that.
You'll be able to see 5 different physique levels: Emmanciated, Underweight, Default, Fat and Obese, which reflect your character condition dynamically.
You'll also have more muscles based on your character strength and fitness level (while they are Default).
Currently, it seems to be only working correctly on SP, but I will try to work towards making it MP compatible (all players that log into the server will have to install the Java files though, so be careful).

HOW TO INSTALL
You'll need to open 2 folders: Your project zomboid base game folder, and the workshop mod folder.
Copy the entire zombie folder to the base game folder.
You can also get the zombie folder here:

or

You need to make sure the mod is enabled FROM THE MAIN MENU, otherwise the skinning data will not load correctly.
If your player skinning data is broken, go to the main menu, make sure Dynamic Body Shape is enabled, and restart the game. It should work correctly after that.
(this is because the player mesh models aren't loaded correctly by the game :P, if you write reloadModelsMatching("MaleBody") in the console, you'll realise what I mean)
That's it. I'll leave an instructive video showing the process.

HOW TO UNINSTALL
I made the java modification as unintrusive as possible, but if you want to uninstall the mod for some reason:
Deactivate the mod from the game, then on steam library right click PZ, go to properties, Installed Files and verify integrity of game files.
COMPATIBILITY
The mod is incompatible with any mod that changes the player model mesh (not textures, just 3D models) (the character rigging would most likely break).
The mod is compatible with clothing mods. However, it is extremely likely that the clothing will clip for Fat and Obese models.
To fix this, it would require an addon for specific clothing mods. It only requires a copy of the clothing Items, with and _Fat and _Obese at the end of the TypeName.
I know that Small Town First Responders (

) added support, for instance.
Works with:
+ Simple Character Retexture , By Hea
~ Rae's Body Mod (the fat and obese model's work, but the muscular seem to not work, will investigate further)
Does not work with:
- Ellies's Hands and Feet Mod
