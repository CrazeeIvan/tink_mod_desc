<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807152393' target='_blank'>Mod 202</a></h2><p>The Research Facility, KY is a full expansion and redesign of the secret military base that can be found to the west of Rosewood, KY. It's design is inspired by the sprawling complex of Black Mesa from the Half-Life series, as well as from the town of Eureka from the TV show Eureka (2006).
The facility conducts advanced research in the areas of high tech aerospace engineering, plant sciences and advanced biomedical research. The facility contains a several large research facilities, a satellite launch facility, a small heliport, a military outpost and a company town to house the employees of the facility.
Gameplay
The entire facility is surrounded by double wide, unclimbable military grade fence, and at the time of gamestart the facility has been placed on a full lockdown. This means it will be impossible to get past the main gate with a car until you
have a sledgehammer
(you can still climb the front gate). The zombie population are very high within the facility, but there are many valuable looting areas and many army vehicle spawns making it a much more attractive late-game looting spot compared to its vanilla counterpart.
"The Biomedical & Engineering Facilities are on full lockdown with shutters blocking off all entrance and exits, if the system worked the infection will be contained" (hint: there are ways in/out without a sledge)
You can spawn within the base, but the spawns are VERY high so it will be a very tough start in terms of numbers if playing on normal or above.
An optional addon is included that connects the Research Facility to Rosewood via a proper main road (see worldmap image for cells)
Compatability
The map uses the cells 18,41 / 18,42 & 19,41 / 19,42.
Works well with...
Fort Redstone 2.0
- This mod was specifically designed to support the new incarnation of Fort Redstone, and does not overlap any of its cells at time of writing.
Raven Creek
-
LOAD Raven Creek AFTER THIS MOD!
Tested with this mod and works fine (they come up right against each other but dont overlap)
Incompatible with...
Slocan Lake (Sort of works, you must put Slocan Lake (and Raven Creek etc) AFTER Research Facility.
Rosewood Access Road (breaks half the map) and is not needed (This map contains its own access road).
Multiplayer / Server
Make sure you go into the server settings, map, and then add this map to the list and move it up to the top of the list to ensure it prioritizes generating the new area rather than the base map (not sure why its an issue within this map).
Special Thanks
DaddyDirk for his tile mod, and his excellent YouTube series that taught me how to map!

Hi all, i thought id give an update on the state of this mod. With the upcoming B42 announced to be this year, including all the changes to heights (negative Z levels especially) I have decided to leave off doing any major reworks/updates until that comes out. That way once B42 is around i can potentially rework the base, add underground areas and more complex structures. Fingers crossed the update is out soonish and the dev tools will be updated with them.
