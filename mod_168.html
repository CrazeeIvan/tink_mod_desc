1. Go to the game's root folder.
2. Open ProjectZomboid.64.json with a text editor
3. Change the lines where you have -Xms... and -Xmx... to -Xms4096m and -Xmx8192m (You might be able to tweak these values if you have more RAM, although they seem to be best for 32GB systems)
4. Note that this file will revert back changes if the game is updated, so you'll have to do this again from time to time.

Details
This mod adds Kingsmouth island to the base map. I tested it with Authentic Z and SuperbSurvivors and both seem to work. I recommend not spawning on the island if you play with low car spawn chance as you might find yourself without a boat to sail to the mainland, leaving you stranded. Mod contains some extra spawn points, courtesy of Breadfeet.
Known Issues
Leave comments if you encounter any other issues that I may or may not be able to fix.
