Plumb Helper
Plumb Helper PLUS
A SIMPLE TOOL FOR  A SIMPLE JOB!
With a
pipe wrench
in your inventory, an option will appear in your context menu. The first option will activate a cursor that shows where water sources are and whether or not the tile is considered "Indoors"
(the two requirements for plumbing sinks).
If the Kentucky Water Supply is still active and your Find Rain Collectors cursor is on a sink that can be plumbed to it, a new icon of a city with a water drop will appear.
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!
Now there's a
SECOND OPTION!
Select it to activate a cursor to find your faucets one floor below! No more running up and down stairs trying to figure out where that sink is!
Sink to new levels with Plumb Helper Plus!
Tooltips:
^The Find Rain Collectors tooltip will show whether you're currently indoors
(only checks when you open the context menu- does not update in real-time to preserve performance)
and whether the KY Water Supply is active
(sandbox option to disable if you find it unimmersive)
Frequently Asked Questions:
Does it work in multiplayer?
Indeed it does!
Does it work with a controller?
You know it!

Can I put this in my server's modpack?
Sure! (Credit and links appreciated)
Are there any known incompatibilities?
Not that I'm aware of. Tested with over 350 mods both online and in solo!
Is it safe to add or remove mid-save?
Yes! The option to show the KY Water Supply status is enabled by default, but can be changed at any time using a mod like
Change Sandbox Options (by Star)
The Texture looks bad, what gives?
If you want cleaner textures, you'll need to disable "Texture Compression" in the Display settings (this also removes the problem of the floor having a visible grid at different zoom levels). This may come at a performance cost, unfortunately.
Translations:
Since there were very few lines, I went ahead and translated it into every language PZ is available in. This was done using Google and DeepL, so the results may not be great, but it should be usable. Any improvements are welcome and appreciated.
Thank you to juni2335 for reminding me about encoding and fixing the Korean translation!
Thank you to Inferno for fixing the Spanish translation!
Thank you to toomanynights for fixing the Russian translation! Check out his excellent QOL mod

Don't forget to rate! It helps the mod more than you'd think!
Tips are never expected but always accepted!
