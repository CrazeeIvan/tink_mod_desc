Our secluded, state of the art facilities feature everything required to tackle all scales of projects. Featuring 3 separate recording suites, mastering room and dubbing facilities, in addition to onsite accommodations and activities! Take a dip into the lake or the pool between takes, stroll our picturesque grounds, shoot a music video at our configurable set, have an in-house chef prepare all your meals, enjoy a cocktail at our fully equipped bar, and rest comfortably and privately in our tailor-made accommodations. Facilities include:
Studio A: The Great Hall
Featuring a historic church organ from the 1880s, this bright and airy massive hall is perfect for those larger than life productions! Features two ISO booths, as well as a massive bay window looks upon the scenic Canvasback Lake. The main room is large enough to accommodate a Franz Kimmer production, including a large upper balcony perfect for choral sections. The control room features the latest LLS 4000 C+ console, and bespoke L'Transmission monitoring system, in addition to a dubbing suite should you need to feature a synchronous soli or dialog.
Studio B: The "Live" Room
Centred around a rare, Steve 8058 console, this room is perfect for the authentic artist. Featuring a greenhouse style roof, elevated playing positions and circular layout, it makes studio B perfect for collaborative, world, jam, or live off the floor styles of recording.
Studio C: The Factory
Affectionately referred to as the "bunker" this punchy, yet configurable room gave birth to the famous Bill Frollins drum sound. Featuring one of a kind pair of Push-Mech compressors and a punchy LLS 4000V console, this room is great for drums, as well as solo acoustic acts.
Studio D: Mastering Suite
Featuring the latest Innuendo software and a perfectly neutral LLS 4000D console, our fully equipped mastering suite can run the gamut from Classical, World, Rock, Jazz and Score recordings. We even mastered last years box office smash "The Chaperone" right in here!
3 Full Accomodation Suites
Our comfortable suites allow for stays of parties up to 10 combined, and feature fully stocked facilites, laundry, kitchen, bar and free reign of the studio. All suites are also self contained for those seeking privacy, or those Ball & Barley style situations!
Our nestled amongst the pines facility is staffed 24/7, features ample parking and is a short drive from the small town of Muldraugh!
