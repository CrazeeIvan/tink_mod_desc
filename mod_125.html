The town grew fast as people wanted to settle somewhere outside of the city but still have all the service and entertainment of the big cities. More and more houses popped up as well as a few small businesses that decided to try their luck in this little town. The growth of AshenWood was well underway when people started hearing about the outbreak. Most people grabbed what they could carry and tried to make it out, leaving everything else behind, causing the growth of the town to halt just as fast as it had started. A few tough people however, decided to stand their ground and fortify what they could in an attempt to fight off whatever this virus would bring with it.
