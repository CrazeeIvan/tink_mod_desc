I made a Discord for the updates on the mods and also for my little streams on Twitch :D
Why no update for more than a year ?
I have lost the motivation to mod Project Zomboid. I will probably get back to it at some point to finish what i started. I would say around when B42 releases. In the meantime, i am sorry if some of my mods are broken/unfinished but i cannot continue them right now. Take care of yourselves guys, don't forget to look pretty for the apocalypse <3
Thanks a lot to
