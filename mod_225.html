Adds Trimble County Power Station and extends the area following east highway of Louisville up to Campbellsburg.
PD: I known that Trimble County Power Station it's located further north near the Ohio river but i prefered to add it to the Louisville east highway area instead of the middle of nowhere without roads.

-Trimble County Power Station (vaguely based on real one)
-La Grange (vaguely based on real one) and surroundings.
-Crestwood (vaguely based on real one) and surroundings.

-Some custom tiles made by me.
-Uses some tiles from the community (Requirements)
-Themed zombies will spawn on the appropiate areas, for example factory workers on factory.
-Full Ingame map support (Except places i don't want to show on the map :) )
-Has custom vehicle spawns on some places, like the roadblocks. (only works if you have any military type vehicle mod or the recommended mods)
-No spawnpoints as this map is outside of the lore military blockades (wich is represented on the map) and on the normal start of the game there should be no zombies and alive people here.
-Working Foragin zones.
-LOTS of traffic Jams, you known people trying to flee in all directions, maybe you want to take a sledgehammer with you :)

If you have issues, remember:
-As with other maps mods, if you visited the adyacent cells, the map may not appear, if that happens you need to start a new game. (this includes early version of the mod)
**
PUT TRIMBLECOUNTYPOWERSTATION FIRST ON MAP ORDER JUST ABOVE MULDRAUGH,KY
***
(only for servers, check pictures to see how to do it)
In server settings if you have trimblecountypowerstation spawn region, unsub and delete the mod folder then resub, if you still see it remove it from spawn regions on server settings. you may also need to delete and redownload the mod on the server.
Future plans:
-Map is finished, maybe ill add something more, but i have to think about it.
But.. there is no spawn points there, what a *******:
This map is located outside of the "Lore" Blockage (which i tried to recreate) so i wanted you to take some time to reach there and arrive when there are only zombies left.
Uses these cells and will not be compatible with any mod that modifies these cells:
50x10,50x11,50x12,50x13,51x10,51x11,51x12,51x13,52x10,52x11,52x12,52x13,53x10,53x11,53x12,53x13,54x10,54x11,54x12,54x13,55x10,55x11,55x12,55x13,56x10,56x11,56x12,56x13,57x10,57x11,57x12,57x13,58x10,58x11,58x12,58x13,59x10,59x11,59x12,59x13,60x10,60x11,60x12,60x13,61x10,61x11,61x12,61x13,62x10,62x11,62x12,62x13
Want to know where is everything? Project  Zomboid Maps did a online map for this: (it has custom tiles don't show on it but it works fine)
https://pzfans.com/project-zomboid-maps/?map_name=Trimble_County_Power_Station_La_Grange
known incompatible maps
-Lexington map
-Luisville Military Base #1
-The Sims Zomboid
-Shelbyville, KY
Issues loading the .pack files?or maybe need a full deletion of the mod?
Un-sub from the mod, go to the 108600 folder in Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\ and delete 2802755864 if stills there, then resub to the mod.
Lags on some parts of the map
may lag a little for maybe 10 secs near the farms as it needs to load the harvestable plants, it stops when they are loaded. (usually happens using Snake mod pack or mods that alter agriculture)
Messed up tiles
Enable double sized textures as this map is done with 2x tiles.
Thanks to the creators of the community buildings.
Also thanks to RingoD123 on the forums for the tutorials on mapping.
Thanks to Daddy Dirkie Dirk,Fantasiado,欧金金,throttlekitty,SleepWell,|wDe| Gernhart Reinholzen and MissRaptor for their tiles, awsome work! :)
