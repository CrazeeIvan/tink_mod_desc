In the small island a madman built a lighthouse all by himself with the excuse that he needed to "signal their coming". The hamlet only prospers with its abundance of fish but still struggles financially, since the main street that connects the hamlet to the city has been taken over by vegetation as if it was moving away from everything.
After being captured and tortured you've been left to die in a small hidden shack of a small distant hamlet.
The near radio on the table informs you of the current news about the new virus infection. You know you're alone and no one is coming back. All you can do is escape or wait until cold and hunger consumes you.
-Why was I captured and tortured? -I don't know man, you tell me.

Knox Country Map Cell: 49_16.
This is my first map creation.
I created this map with the intention of starting the game in a different way, using the Negative traits: Injured and Broken Leg from "
More Traits
". The idea was to start the game in a difficult situation but not so suffocating like "A Really CD DA" Challenge. I tried to give as much "life" as possible in the buildings to make sure it doesn't look so much blend as the vanilla ones, also secrets can be found in some them.
Some buildings may be burnt or barricaded with lots of loot in it, but it's not my doing, the game randomly mark some buildings to spawn this way.
In the spawn point you start in a cage and most of the time it is locked (as it should be) so I recommend the "
Better Lockpicking
" Mod and spawn-cheat some bobbypin's and a screwdrive into your inventory, also the "Lockpicking magazine" if you didn't take the "locksmith" trait of course.
I also recommend the mod "
Real Ladder
" If you want to climb some roofs.
