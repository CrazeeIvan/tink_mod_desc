Petyarbilt 379
, also called
Petya
, is the dream of many American truckers.
The long hood, impressive grille and bumper, massive mufflers and air filter housings, abundance of chrome, polished aluminum and stainless steel make the hearts of connoisseurs beat faster.
The local transportation vehicles are equipped with a short two-man aluminum cabin.
On long haulage routes there are tractors equipped with Ofiget' Cab Sleeper System. Any type of sleeper compartment can be attached to the standard cab.
The most comfortable of them are distinguished by elegance and richness of the interior design:
two mattresses;
refrigerator;
microwave;
nightstand.
The driver's workplace is equipped with an air-suspended seat, high back, folding armrests, three-point seat belts, and mechanisms for spatial adjustment of the cushion and backrest.
Add to all this the automated hitch system, allowing you to hook and unhook the trailer
RIGHT FROM THE CABIN
, and you understand why you need this Truck.
All right, that's the end of the prelude! Want to know how to turn this truck into a real monster? It's time to get the new issue of Autotsar Tuning Atelier magazine! But be warned right away: you must be a true mechanic-professional to build all the available armor.
P.s. HUGE capacity trailers are supplied with the truck! Trailers used by well-known companies such as: DHГ, FedЯ, DEAN MCKAY. When Z-Day happened, some of them were still packed to the brim. So don't pass up an opportunity to crack them open.
