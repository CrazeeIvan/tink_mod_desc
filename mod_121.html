When ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan, many like minded citizens headed straight for the museum, knowing it contained historical weapons and armour that would be of use in this exact event.
Sadly, a few infected citizens had the same idea and now the museum is home to an unexpected field trip- walking corpses.
Perhaps one or two interesting historical artefacts remain inside... what will you discover?
Please Read-
None of the custom mannequins are containers. Instead, most exhibition rooms have containers with a sign that says "Try Me On". You may find appropriate loot in these if you have certain mods installed. You can find the mod list in the collection above.
Custom in-game map, foraging and spawn point are included in this map.
This mod also includes unique & custom clothes such as a Museum Jacket, Crowns & Union clothing.
Cell 35 x 27
Hundreds of custom assets that you can loot from the museum.
The map is high risk high reward. Do not expect clearing it to be easy.
Has to be a new game. Will not work on current saves.
Not compatible with the map mod Applebran.
List of Exhibitions-
Project Jurassic, Animals of the World, Samurai & Ninja's, Early Humans, Abraham Lincoln's Birthplace, Native Americans, The Wild West, The American Civil War 'Union', World War 1, The Middle Ages, The Ancient Egyptians, South American History, The Rotten Romans... and a few other secret spaces within the museum.
