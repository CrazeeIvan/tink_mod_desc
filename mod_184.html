<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2926652828' target='_blank'>Mod 184</a></h2><p>This checkpoint station has everything you need for your starter base, located on the outskirts of Muldraugh.
**Beginner-friendly Map especially for those who are still new to the game**
There's still zombie spawns inside the checkpoint, but it can be easily cleared out.
This map is located just outside of muldraugh, and it's also connected to the main road if you ever need to go to town. A good area for your base since it's just outside the zombie infested city and with enough resources to help you survive. It's also surrounded by forest and foliage for gathering and building if you want to expand. And a lake nearby for fishing and farming.
Compatibility:
-This map is located in
35x29
. So any modded map location that's also using this area might conflict or overlap with this map, please check before adding to your game.
-Compatible with
Chinatown
& it's
Expansion Version
[unless the expanded version of chinatown, extends on this area of the map in the future.]
-Compatible with
[NS Car Workshop]
the side road on my map connects to this one, or any mod map that's above 35x29.
*New Update*
There are two modes on this new patch:
[Choose and enable only one in your game]
Choose '
Muldraugh Checkpoint Safehouse
' - if you want the beginner-friendly version, with less zombie spawns.
OR
Choose '
Muldraugh Checkpoint Safehouse[H]
' - this is an increased zombie spawn making it a HARDER difficulty for those who are looking an extra challenge.(Requested)
**Remember to choose only one mode in your game**

P.S.
I will probably not expand or change alot of things on this map since this is just a test-map. So if there are any fixes needed, i will update or fix it when i have the time. Since this is an old-map that i made months ago. And i just want to share it for those who are interested and to those who want to add it to their game. I hope you guys like and enjoy this map :)
