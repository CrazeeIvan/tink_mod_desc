With the set there are a number of movie and game posters all of which are 1993 or before to fit in with the timeline of the game. Also i modified all the brick wall textures found in the base game and any of the tile packs that are required for the Elliot Pond map to fit with the awesome windows from Extra Noise's New burbs tile pack.
There are also a number of custom store signs and objects that are specific to the Elliot Pond map. Feel free to use them as seen fit just please give credit where its due. thanks and enjoy
Thanks to ThrottleKitty for use of a wall which i coloured changed,Skizot for the Massage Chair Textures, Daddy Dirk for use of his ikea shelves for a overlay.
