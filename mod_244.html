Well your prayers are answered. With these tilesheets you can achieve it through mapping!
All assets are included in the mod as well as the properties that work the best.
Feel free to adjust, tweak or edit them, but do not release as your own and give credit etc plz
Update 1/3/23  -- Sorry if this busts anything for ya'll but I forgot to add rocks for different cliff heights -- they're in the pack now.
UPDATE 1/28/23 -- THIS IS HUGE.  Thanks to Alree's insightful help, I was able to add a lua file that adds support for multilevel foraging. You will now be able to place foraging objects in the map editor on levels higher than 0 and be able to forage on those levels in game with this mod installed and activated!   IMPORTANT: THIS MOD MUST NOW BE ACTIVATED IN ORDER FOR THESE CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT!!!!
