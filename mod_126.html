Now V41.6+ compatible!
Works with new in-game map system.
Includes lootable map of Bedford Falls that updates the main map when read!
U=BTL
Mod has been tested both in single player and in multiplayer and everything works 100%
If you are having issues then it is most likely caused by another mod, incorrectly trying to add Bedford Falls to a game already in progress or by not having your map mods at the very top of your mod order.
If you are running a map pack mod and have issues with Bedford Falls then my first piece of advice will always be to uninstall the map pack and use the seperate map mods instead, as they were intended to be used.
If you are hosting a local server or standalone server then don't forget to add Bedford Falls to the Workshop tab/line and the mods tab/line and that "BedfordFalls;North;South;West" are in/on your maps tab/line and above/before any other mod, if you have map mods that are not behaving correctly a likely reason in your map mods are not at the front/top of your mod and workshop lists!

Do not repack and/or re-upload without permission, if you want to add Bedford Falls to a "mod pack" then make and use a collection, that is what they are there for. You can add Bedford Falls to your "server pack" ONLY IF your mod pack's visibility is unlisted so that only people with the link (people who will play on your server) can view it.</p></body></html>
