This mod addresses the need of vanilla friendly food preservation. Make smoked or salted meat/fish, canned food, vinegar, ethanol, glue, salt and much more. Use ethanol to make vodka or to refill a generator, refine food to biogas, find salt rocks and crush them to salt. It is also a good workaround for not having natural cold storage system - YET.
HUNTING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS MOD AND IS NOT ALSO REQUIRED FOR THIS MOD TO WORK. YOU NEED TO SUBSCRIBE IT SEPARETLY IF YOU WANT TO HUNT!
Use
Craft Helper
to see exact unit quantities of some of the recipes.
Canning details :
Can carrots, cabbage and tomatoes. Cans last forever, just as in vanilla.
Overhauled vanilla jarring - jars last about an year now. They also give back a empty jar and a lid when opened.
Vanilla potatoes and cabbages are heavier and potatoes last longer - 30 to 60 days. It is implied the potatoes are kept in somewhere cool.
Meatwork details :
All meat related recipes will accept meat by the unit - no matter how it has been cut.
Meat can be
canned
,
salted
,
smoked
or eaten in any other way you want.
All bigger animals(From
Immersive Hunting
mod) , depending on their size, will produce certain amount of steak slabs, leather strips and bones when butchered.
Big steak slabs can be cut into smaller pieces to be shared with a friend, stored, cooked or traded more easily.
Small trapped/hunted animal, both from vanilla and Hunting Mod are butchered the vanilla way.
Raw canned meat needs to be heated in fire so it will change to normal canned meat.
Smoked meat/fish needs to be smoked for about 10-12 hours. Lasts 6-10 days.
Salted meat can also be made from various meat types. Lasts 15-20 days.
You can also mine salt and various other stuff with my :
Dynamic Mining
mod.
Smoking/Salting Tutorial
: PZ has such thing as units - these units can be either measured in drainable items as delta or they can be hunger value on food items. To prepare your meat for smoking/salting you need ONE unit of whatever kind of RAW MEAT, this will create you a "starter item". The whole system is not not new or made up by me but the usual evolved recipe(Stir Fry, Pie, Soup etc etc). Only difference is that in my version you need to craft the initial item from the food itself - there is no other item involved. Now you can click on that new item and start adding more meat to it, until its full and then cook it over the fire.
Brewing details :
Brew Ethanol from potatoes/corn and yeast.
Brew Vinegar from ethanol and vegetables.
Brewing and canning equipment such as wooden barrels and can sealers can be either looted or crafted.
Just make a brew and place the barrel on the ground and leave it be.
Ethanol takes 15 days to get ready.
Vinegar takes 10 days to get ready.
When the brew is ready, you can open the barrel while holding 5 empty bottles and voilaa - you get 5 bottles of ethanol/vinegar and your barrel can be used for the next brew.
Ethanol+Water can be mixed into vodka.
Ethanol can be also used as fuel.
You can use the vodka as a drink or to disinfect stuff.
Other :
Sweet Juice can be stomped out of certain veggies and used as sugar - it also produces yeast as a by product.
Mushrooms can be stomped straight to yeast.
Cook tallow from any animal meat.
Make candles from tallow. Candles last 6 times longer.
Tallow can be used in cooking recipes as an oil/lard/margarine.
Glue can be made out of bones and leather. Glue lasts 2 times longer.
Soap can be made out of animal meat. Soap lasts 5 times longer.
Make dried berries out of strawberries.
Foragable salt rocks that can be crushed into salt(Found in Forests/Vegetation/Farmlands).
Refining Biogas(Propane) from all sorts of food.
You can empty all cans(Vanilla too) from food(Even rotten).
Tweaked strategic lootable food nutrition values(Canned/Dried/Chips/Sweets)
Realistic calories for various vanilla foods. I also suggest using
Calorie burn tweaker
and
Weight change speed
to make the overall hunger system more balanced.
Everything related to canning, jarring, smoking, salting and brewing needs a certain skill + a recipe book.
Updates to this mod are 100% savegame friendly and wont break anything. Works in MP and is friendly with both vanilla and other mods.
