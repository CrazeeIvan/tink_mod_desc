The default preservation mechanics for jarring are pretty unrealistic. This mod aims to consolidate several different ideas into a single mod. This mod does not remove the default recipe for jarring but adds two alternative ways to jar and pickle food more reflective of reality.
Jarred Food:
Jarred food now returns the lid and the jar when opened.
Jarring food only requires water but still needs to be cooked. The requirement for vinegar and sugar is removed.
Jarred food will last up to 1 year until stale and 2 years until rotten (Default in the vanilla game is 3 months until rotten).
Pickled Foods:
Pickling food requires a lid, jar, water, vinegar, salt and sugar.
They do not require cooking and will keep food fresh for 3 years and from rotting up to 5 years.
Pickled food are more in-line with the vanilla recipe but with a greatly increased shelf life to better reflect the difficulty involved in acquiring all the ingredients to pickle.
Preserving Meat and Fruit:
You can jar or pickle meat in the same way as outlined above. Only works on food acquired through fishing or trapping (Rabbit, Bird etc).
You can create jerky by combining salt and 2 butchered meats. The final result will add the hunger values together but can not be any better than -100.
You can create fruit jam and marmalade using a jar, varying quantities of fruit, and sugar.
All fruit jam and marmalade will give a jar and lid when eaten.
Stale and rotten food will add sadness and boredom to jerky, jam and marmalade, but rotten ingredients will not add food poisoning.
Additional Changes:
Loot rate for jars, lids, boxes of jars, vinegar, salt and sugar have all been increased.
Increased the variety of containers that jars and salt can spawn in.
Jar freshness is 99% accurate to its contents. Works with eris food expiry mod
**
Add recipe to put jars back into a box
Alternate mod to require reading a few magazines to unlock the recipes.
Bugs:
Vanilla jar recipes are still available but there is no clean way to remove them. Just ignore them.
Instead of storing jarred food hunger values individually, it's all averaged together and given back averaged too. Recipe code doesn't let you operate on individual items that come out of the jar, so this is the only way to keep the input equal to the output.
**
Using Eris Food Expiry mod will display jarred food expiration date incorrectly when uncooked. You need to cook the jars to get the 2 year until rotten trait, otherwise you could open a fresh jar to receive rotten contents. Debug menu displays correct values. Once the jar of food is cooked the Eris Expiry mod will work correctly and display accurate data.
Having a way to preserve food for long periods of time seemed to be a balancing issue to the devs but considering how common canned food can be even on rare loot settings being able to stockpile farmed food at the expense of rare resources (jars etc.) seems balanced to us.
Other mods that work well with this one:
AnaLGiN's Renewable Food Resources
for foraging and growing ingredients
Jarring Made Easy
for crafting jarring items and ingredients
Choose only one Mod ID! Mags locks all the recipes behind 5 magazines - one for jerky, one for jam, one for marmalade, one for jars of vegetables and one for jars of meat. They closely mimic spawn rates of vanilla skill magazines.
