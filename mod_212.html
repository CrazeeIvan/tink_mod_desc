Southwood is the predecessor of Riverside. Unlike the world line in Kentucky in 1993, the original site of Riverside has not been gradually abandoned due to relocation. On the contrary, it has explored a new development model and become a small town that mainly relies on industry and agriculture and animal husbandry to achieve economic prosperity.
In the current version, southwood has been extended to 3 Ã— 3cells. You can explore a whole McCoy factory requisitioned by the army, a huge riverview house for you to live in, and complete animal husbandry facilities and farmland to prepare for the b42 version. In addition, there are all kinds of new ordnance stores waiting for you to plunder!
Remember to prepare a sledgehammer when you get to the center of town!
