Some of the tile sheets are within the mod folder itself. The rest will be released when they are properly edited or if requested on the mapping discord.
Several room definitions have been added and can also be used by mappers. (this will not effect any vanilla spawns)
This mod includes some weapons that will be rare if ever seen. The Axe is the only weapon that will spawn and it will only appear after a set amount of days.
Features:
Ugly 70's wallpaper (just like my Gran used to have)
FireDoors
Missing roofcaps and double door frames of Vanilla wall variants
Custom fencing
Hanging wall vines
Decaying wallpaper (probably what your here for)
A bunch of random furniture (there is no order to it on the tile sheets, soz)
