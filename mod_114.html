I'm back with a another creation.
Item List:
- Winchester Model 1873
- Sawn Off Winchester 1873
The weapon can be found on Gun Shops, Police Lockers, Weapon Stashes, and very very rare inside School Lockers. (Why not?)
You can attach "Scopes" and "Recoil Pads" on the rifle.
You can saw off the rifle to give more space on your inv.
