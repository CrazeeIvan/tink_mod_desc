Vanilla reading speed is about 2 pages per in game minute, a Beginner skill book will take 440 minutes in game to read. You can use this to base how fast of an option in game you would like to use.
Slow Reader / Fast Reader traits still have an effect and will make reading faster or slower by 30% of the new adjusted speed.

This is only compatible with B41 and tested working in MP.
MOD OPTIONS UPDATE
The core code has changed a bit to incorporate the Mod Options Mod. Please ensure that you have it installed in order to be able to see the mod options selections in the options menu while playing.
