<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2728416041' target='_blank'>Mod 311</a></h2><p>It sucks when you log in to a server and find all your farming efforts were in vain because too much time passed and everything is rotten. This mod aims to solve that problem by disabling that final stage, leaving all the crops in their "seed-bearing" stage or equivalent.
Details
There's another mod with the same purpose (
Farming Never Rot
) but a lot of mods override it and I haven't managed to make it work. This mod takes another, more direct, approach and simply overwrites the rottenThis function, making it impossible for a crop to actually rot.
Compatibility
It should work with just about everything.
Tested with Snake's ModPack, Xnertot Farmable Trees, Mo' Crops and AnaLGiN's Renewable Food Resources (separately).
