<html><head><title>Mod Description</title></head><body><h2><a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791656602' target='_blank'>Mod 312</a></h2><p>This mod will add several vehicles to the game. The vehicles are vanilla-styled (including lore-friendly names, or optional real names), era appropriate (1993 and earlier), and support all the features of vanilla vehicles. The pack will be a variety pack, aiming to add a little bit of everything to the game from everyday sedans, vans and SUVs to sports cars, with sports cars being much more rare than everyday machines.
All cars that are capable of it also support
Paint Your Ride!
Note: This mod will update on
Wednesdays
It may not be every Wednesday, but if something is ready for release, that's when I'll update
If you were using my existing standalone vehicle mods, it is
safe (and best)
to switch to this mod.
This mod contains the following vehicle mods of mine: Lancia Stratos, R32 Skyline, Supra, Fox Body, Kei Sports, LM002, 240SX Coupe, Diablo, 300ZX, GT40, Miata, Toyota X90s, and Reliant Robin Mk. II. Disable these mods and use this instead if you plan on using this mod, as they can cause issues when used together.
You can choose which cars you would like to spawn naturally, from 3 selections of car lists
If you want all cars to spawn, you don't need to enable the optional Spawn Selection sub-mods
To choose which types of cars you'd like to have spawn, enable the Spawn Selection sub-mods of the cars you would like to allow to spawn in addition to the main mod. There are 3 lists to choose from, and you can select any combination of them:
US Motors:
This list contains cars that were available and sold in the US. Examples include the Bronco, Mustang, and 240SX.
Imports:
This list contains cars that were not available and sold in the US, but common in other countries. Examples are the R32 Skyline, Toyota Mark II, and Reliant Robin
Rares and Exotics:
This list contains cars that are either very expensive or produced in very low numbers. Examples are the GT40, Diablo, and Stratos.
Also note that the imports and exotics are both very rare in the base spawn lists, and the Spawn Selection sub-mods will not make them more common.
What's new in the pack?
The newest addition is the AMG Mercedes-Benz 600SEL. This particular model has parts made by AMG before they officially became a part of Mercedes. New ID: fhqV140_600SEL_AMG
Additionally, the mod has been translated to German thanks to Eaglefire. Check out their German Project Zomboid community

This mod pairs well with
Vehicle Spawn Zones Expanded.
Since the exotic and import cars are very rare, I started work on the spawn zones to give some specified areas for these cars to spawn, so there is a decent chance to find them on a save without it potentially becoming overwhelming. It eventually became more, adding a variety of new spawn areas beyond that. It works very well with this mod, and has many spawn lists for cars in this pack.

FAQ
Q: Multiplayer compatible?
A:
Yes!
In general, all of my (and many of others') vehicles will be MP compatible unless stated otherwise.
Q: Can this be used with other vehicle mods?
A:
Yes!
It will work with other vehicle packs, and standalone vehicle mods. This mod was even made with use alongside mods like Filibuster Rhymes' Used Cars in mind, and has its spawn chances based around it. It doesn't alter anything vanilla either, so anything that changes vanilla vehicles will also work!
Q: What are the vehicle IDs?
A: I've set up a post in the discussions with each vehicle ID and some small information about each car, check it out if you need the IDs.
Q: How rare are the exotic/import cars?
A: They are
very
rare, exotics in particular will be difficult to find on default (low) and normal car spawn rates. Exotics and imports will mostly only spawn near high-end houses, or anywhere else you can find the Cossette and Lang 4000 in vanilla, at a lower spawn rate. Some Easter Egg cars will spawn in similar areas to the Easter Egg cars from Used Cars. For some more specific hints,
Riverside has a very large amount of possible spawn zones, and the bar across from the junkyard contains only sports car spawns, so that is the best place to look.
Q: Can this be added mid-save?
A:
Yes!
Vehicles will only spawn in areas you have not explored yet however, so if you or your server have been all over the map, you may have trouble finding the vehicles. I'd recommend using
Udderly Vehicle Respawn
if you want to use this on an existing save, it will allow new vehicles to spawn in explored areas the world.
Q: I'm having issues joining/starting a server in MP (File mismatch, or connection lost after starting)
A: First, check AuthenticPeach's guide about these issues
here.

Q: Can you make (x)?
A: If you're going to request a car, note that my main focus at the moment are cars that fit the game's time period (1993 and earlier). I do have cars outside of this timeframe on my list, but it may be a while before I get to them. I also already have quite a few on my list, so there's no guarantee I'll get to all of them.
Q: What about animations?
A: Animations are planned to officially come to vanilla vehicles, so they are planned for this pack as well. While I will redo some cars before TIS' animations are officially available, they will be released as separate mods for the time being with options to replace the ones in the pack, due to some features not working with animated parts. I'm still going to add vehicles in the current vanilla style to the pack, better set up for the upcoming animations.
